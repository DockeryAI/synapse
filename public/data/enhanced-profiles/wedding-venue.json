After hosting [NUMBER] weddings, I'm spilling the tea on what to actually look for during venue tours (because those Pinterest-perfect photos don't tell the whole story) 👀\n\n✅ WHAT TO CHECK:\n\n1. Bathrooms (seriously!) - Are there enough? Are they nice enough for your guests to Instagram in? 😅\n\n2. Parking situation - Will Grandma have to walk a mile in heels?\n\n3. The backup plan - Don't just ask IF they have one, ask to SEE it. Is it equally beautiful or just 'functional'?\n\n4. Vendor flexibility - Required vendor lists can add $5K-10K to your budget. Ask what's mandatory vs. recommended.\n\n5. Sound restrictions - That 10pm hard stop might kill your dance floor vibe\n\n6. What 'setup included' really means - Do they set up YOUR decorations or just tables/chairs?\n\n7. Day-of coordinator - Is it the person you're talking to now or someone you'll meet the week before?\n\n❌ RED FLAGS:\n→ They won't let you visit during an actual wedding\n→ Pricing isn't transparent in writing\n→ Bad reviews all mention the same issue\n→ They're pushy about booking TODAY\n\n💡 PRO TIP: Visit during your same season/time of day. That 'magical lighting' in summer photos might not exist in your January wedding.\n\nWhat's something you wish you'd known before booking your venue?

Weather happens.\n\n✅ **Check the bathrooms**\nYour guests will spend time there. Are they nice enough for photos? Enough stalls for [GUEST_COUNT] people?\n\n✅ **Request pricing in writing**\n'Starting at $X' means nothing. What does YOUR wedding actually cost with everything included?\n\n✅ **Meet your actual coordinator**\nThe sales person ≠ the day-of coordinator. Will you work with the person you're meeting today?\n\n✅ **Ask about vendor restrictions**\nRequired vendor lists can add $5K-10K to your budget. Get the list upfront.\n\n✅ **Test the timeline**\nWalk through: When do you get access? When must you leave? Is there a hard stop for music?\n\n✅ **See it in your season**\nThat summer photo might not reflect your January lighting. Visit during your actual time of day.\n\n**BONUS:** Download our complete 47-point venue comparison worksheet [LINK]\n\n---\n\n**Ready to tour [VENUE_NAME]?**\n\nWe believe in total transparency (yes, even about our limitations).
