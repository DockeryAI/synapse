After doing this for [NUMBER] years, here's exactly what works:\n\n🛁 THE FIRST 24 HOURS MATTER MOST:\n- No hot water (sorry, no hot yoga or long showers)\n- No cleaning products without gloves\n- Let the gel fully cure (it's still hardening!)\n\n🧴 DAILY MAINTENANCE:\n- Cuticle oil morning and night (yes, really)\n- Gloves for dishes, cleaning, gardening\n- Hand cream that's actually nail-safe (ask me which ones!)\n\n⚠️ WARNING SIGNS TO WATCH:\n- Lifting at cuticles? Book a repair within 48 hours\n- Dull finish? That's product buildup, not wear\n- Catching on things? The edge needs resealing\n\n🔧 THE SECRET WEAPON:\nCome back at week 2 for a free edge reseal (takes 5 minutes, free for our regulars). This single step doubles your wear time.\n\nReal talk: Your manicure's longevity is 50% the application, 50% your aftercare. We handle our half—this guide handles yours.\n\nQuestions? Drop them below! I'll answer every single one.\n\nAnd if you're dealing with constant chipping, DM me.
