        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\n**BEFORE:** I saw your property at [PROPERTY_ADDRESS] has been on the market for [NUMBER] days.\n\nLet me show you what that means in real dollars:\n\nExpected rent: $[MONTHLY_RENT]\n[NUMBER] days vacant: $[VACANCY_COST] lost\nProjected to fill in: [NUMBER] more days\nAdditional loss: $[ADDITIONAL_LOSS]\n\nTotal cost so far: $[TOTAL_COST]\n\nI'm not telling you this to make you feel bad. I'm telling you because I can help.\n\n**BRIDGE:** Here's what's probably happening:\n\n❌ Priced [PERCENTAGE]% above comparable properties\n❌ Photos don't showcase the property's best features  \n❌ Showing process is inconvenient for prospective tenants\n❌ Application processing is slow\n❌ Marketing limited to [CURRENT_PLATFORM]\n\nHow do I know? Because we manage [NUMBER]+ properties in [CITY] and we see this pattern constantly.\n\n**AFTER:** Here's what changes when we take over:\n\n**Day 1-2:**\n- Professional photos taken\n- Competitive market analysis completed\n- Property listed on [NUMBER] platforms\n- Pricing optimized for [NUMBER]-day fill\n\n**Day 3-7:**\n- Flexible showing schedule (including evenings/weekends)\n- Pre-screened applicants touring property\n- Applications processed within 24 hours\n- Multiple qualified candidates\n\n**Day 8-14:**\n- Tenant selected and approved\n- Lease signed\n- Move-in scheduled\n- First rent payment collected\n\nOur average fill time: [NUMBER] days\nYour current trajectory: [NUMBER]+ days\n\n**THE MATH:**\n\nIf you continue alone:\n- [NUMBER] more days vacant = $[ADDITIONAL_COST]\n- Total vacancy cost: $[TOTAL_VACANCY]\n\nIf we take over today:\n- Estimated fill: [NUMBER] days\n- Vacancy cost: $[REDUCED_COST]\n- Your savings: $[SAVINGS]\n- Our fee: [PERCENTAGE]% = $[MONTHLY_FEE]/month\n\n**First year comparison:**\n- Your way: $[ANNUAL_RENT] - $[VACANCY_LOSS] = $[NET_INCOME_DIY]\n- Our way: $[ANNUAL_RENT] - $[REDUCED_VACANCY] - $[ANNUAL_FEE] = $[NET_INCOME_PRO]\n- Difference: $[BENEFIT]\n\nAnd that's just year one. Our [PERCENTAGE]% tenant retention rate means fewer vacancies going forward.\n\n**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**\n\n**Option 1:** Keep doing what you're doing and hope it fills soon\n\n**Option 2:** Let's talk for 15 minutes\n\nI'll:\n✓ Review your current listing and pricing\n✓ Show you comparable properties that filled quickly\n✓ Explain exactly how we'd market your property\n✓ Give you a realistic timeline and cost analysis\n✓ No pressure, just information\n\n**[SCHEDULE 15-MIN CALL BUTTON]**\n\nOr if you prefer, reply to this email with:\n1. Current asking rent\n2. Property details (bed/bath/sqft)\n3. Any recent updates/renovations\n\nI'll send you a free competitive analysis by end of day [DAY].\n\n**The reality:** Every day you wait is $[DAILY_COST] you won't get back.\n\nYou've already lost $[CURRENT_LOSS]. Let's not make it $[PROJECTED_LOSS].\n\nLooking forward to helping you fill this property,\n\n[SIGNATURE]\n[COMPANY_NAME]\n[PHONE]\n[CALENDAR_LINK]\n\nP.S. Even if you decide not to use our management services, I'll share the pricing and marketing insights from our analysis. Sometimes small adjustments make a big difference."
