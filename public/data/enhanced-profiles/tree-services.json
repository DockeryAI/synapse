Here's what to look for RIGHT NOW before storm season:\n\n🔴 5 Warning Signs Your Tree Is About to Fail:\n\n1. CRACKS IN THE TRUNK\nLook for vertical splits or separations in the bark. Even small cracks can indicate major structural failure risk. If you can fit a credit card in the crack, get it assessed immediately.\n\n2. DEAD BRANCHES IN THE CANOPY\nDead wood = brittle wood. These become missiles during storms. If more than 25% of branches are dead, the whole tree is compromised.\n\n3. LEANING MORE THAN 15 DEGREES\nTrees don't suddenly lean—it means root failure is happening. Measure it: if it's leaning more than it was last year, you have active failure in progress.\n\n4. FUNGUS/MUSHROOMS AT THE BASE\nThis is the #1 sign of root rot. By the time you see mushrooms, 50-70% of the root system is already decayed. These trees fail without warning.\n\n5. HOLLOW TRUNK OR CAVITIES\nTap the trunk with your knuckles. Solid trees sound solid. Hollow sounds = hollow trees. A tree can lose 70% of its interior and still look healthy from outside.\n\n💡 What to do if you spot these signs:\n\n✅ Take photos for documentation\n✅ Keep people and pets away from the area\n✅ Call an ISA certified arborist (not just a \"tree guy\")\n✅ Get written assessment for your insurance records\n✅ Don't wait for storm season—these don't get better\n\nI'm offering FREE emergency assessments this week for [CITY/AREA] homeowners. We'll give you a written report you can submit to your insurance company.\n\nComment below or message me if you've spotted any of these warning signs. Your family's safety is worth a 20-minute inspection.\n\nShare this with neighbors—tree failures don't just damage your property, they can affect the whole street.\n\n#TreeSafety #HomeownerTips #StormPrep #[City]Community #TreeCare #ISACertified",

They're sending notices requiring certified arborist assessments and removal within 30-60 days or they'll drop your coverage.\n\nThis isn't a scare tactic—I'm seeing actual cancellations for homeowners who miss the deadline.\n\n🎯 WHY THIS IS HAPPENING:\n\nAfter major storm losses in [RECENT YEAR/EVENT], insurers are reducing risk exposure. They've identified that tree-related claims cost them $[AMOUNT] annually, and they're being proactive about eliminating high-risk properties.\n\nTrees within falling distance of structures, dead trees over [HEIGHT] feet, and certain species known for failure are being flagged automatically.\n\n✅ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:\n\n1. If you received a notice, DO NOT IGNORE IT\nThese deadlines are firm. Miss it and you'll be scrambling to find new insurance (at much higher rates) while also dealing with tree removal.\n\n2. Get an ISA Certified Arborist Assessment\nYour insurance company requires documentation from certified professionals—not just any tree service. We provide written reports that satisfy insurance requirements.\n\n3. Understand Your Options\nNot every flagged tree needs immediate removal. Sometimes pruning, cabling, or other treatments can satisfy the insurance requirement. A qualified arborist can give you options.\n\n4. Document Everything\nKeep copies of all assessments, removal receipts, and correspondence with your insurance company. This protects you if there are future claims.\n\n💼 OUR RESPONSE:\n\nWe're prioritizing insurance-required assessments and removals. We provide:\n• Same-day or next-day emergency assessments\n• Written reports with ISA certification documentation\n• Direct communication with insurance companies when needed\n• Full liability coverage and certificates of insurance\n• Complete removal with documentation for your file\n\nIf you've received a notice, message me directly. We're scheduling emergency responses for insurance-required work and can usually complete assessments within 24-48 hours.\n\nFor everyone else: NOW is the time to get ahead of this. Don't wait for the letter. A preventive assessment costs $[PRICE] and could save you from losing your coverage.\n\nQuestions? Drop them below.

HOLLOW TRUNK\n→ Tap it—hollow sound = hollow tree\n→ Can look healthy but have zero structural integrity\n\nSOLUTION:\nWalk your property this weekend.
