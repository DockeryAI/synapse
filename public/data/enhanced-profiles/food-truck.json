INGREDIENTS: Check if they're using [AUTHENTIC_INGREDIENT] or the Americanized substitute. Big difference in flavor.\n\n3. PREPARATION: Traditional [CUISINE_TYPE] involves [SPECIFIC_TECHNIQUE]. If they're taking shortcuts, you'll taste it.\n\n4. THE SMELL: Authentic cooking smells like [DESCRIPTION]. If it smells like a fast-food joint, that's your answer.\n\n5. ASK ABOUT FAMILY RECIPES: We use Chef [NAME]'s grandmother's recipe for our [SIGNATURE_SAUCE]. Real food trucks have real stories.\n\nWhy does this matter?
