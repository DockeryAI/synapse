Here's what [NUMBER] years of early childhood education has taught me:\n\nThe \"right time\" isn't about age—it's about developmental readiness. Here are the signs kindergarten teachers say matter most:\n\n✅ YOUR CHILD IS READY IF THEY CAN:\n• Separate from you for short periods without extreme distress\n• Communicate basic needs (even if not perfectly)\n• Show interest in other children (even if shy)\n• Follow simple 1-2 step directions\n• Use the bathroom independently (or close to it—we help with potty training!)\n\n❌ YOUR CHILD MIGHT NEED MORE TIME IF:\n• Separation causes severe anxiety lasting 30+ minutes\n• They're not yet interested in peers at all\n• Basic communication is very limited\n\nBUT HERE'S THE TRUTH: Most \"readiness\" skills are exactly what preschool TEACHES. \n\nAt [SCHOOL_NAME], we've welcomed children at all starting points. Our [CURRICULUM_NAME] approach meets each child where they are.\n\n[PARENT_NAME]'s daughter started barely talking. Within 2 months, she was singing songs and using 4-5 word sentences.

Social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, conflict resolution)\n2. Executive function (focus, self-control, following directions)\n3.

Love of learning and curiosity\n\nNotice what's NOT on that list? Knowing all letters by age 3.\n\nWHAT PLAY-BASED LEARNING ACTUALLY TEACHES:\n\n🧱 Block building → Spatial reasoning, math concepts, problem-solving, cooperation\n🎨 Art projects → Fine motor skills (essential for writing), creativity, following multi-step directions\n🎭 Dramatic play → Language development, perspective-taking, emotional regulation\n🔬 Science exploration → Hypothesis testing, observation skills, critical thinking\n📚 Story time → Literacy foundation, listening skills, comprehension\n\nAt [SCHOOL_NAME], our play-based curriculum is INTENTIONAL. Every activity has learning objectives. The difference? Children are engaged, excited learners instead of stressed test-takers.\n\nTHE PROOF:\n→ [X]% of our graduates test into gifted programs\n→ [X]% read at or above grade level by 1st grade\n→ Kindergarten teachers specifically request our graduates for leadership roles\n\nPlay isn't the opposite of learning.

Include research but make it parent-friendly.",

Transparent pricing builds trust and gets shared in parent groups asking about preschool costs.",
