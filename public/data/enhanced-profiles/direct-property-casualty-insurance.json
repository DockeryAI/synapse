Policy covered the pipe repair ($800) but NOT the basement restoration because it was considered \"below grade water intrusion.\"\n\nShe didn't have the $[AMOUNT]/year water backup endorsement.\n\nHere's what TO DO:\n\n1. Call your agent and ask specifically about:\n   → Water backup coverage\n   → Sump pump endorsement\n   → Service line coverage\n   → Flood insurance (if near water)\n\n2. Check your declarations page for these endorsements\n\n3. If missing, add them NOW (before you need them)\n\nTotal cost for full water protection: Usually $[AMOUNT]-[AMOUNT]/year\nAverage water damage claim: $[AMOUNT]\n\nWorth it? Absolutely.\n\nDrop a 💧 if you're checking your policy today. Share to help someone avoid a $[AMOUNT] surprise.\n\nQuestions?

Here's what companies don't advertise:\n\nThe \"Loyalty Penalty\" is real:\n• New customers get rates 15-30% lower than renewals\n• Your \"loyalty discount\" (usually 5-10%) doesn't offset annual rate increases\n• Companies count on you not shopping around\n• Average customer overpays $[AMOUNT]/year by year 5\n\nReal example from last week:\nClient with [CARRIER] for 12 years\nPaying: $3,847/year\nLoyal customer discount: $192\n\nWe quoted same coverage: $2,615/year\nSavings: $1,232/year\n\nShe was literally paying $1,000+ more for \"loyalty.\"\n\nHere's what I tell everyone:\n\n✓ Shop your insurance every 2-3 years (minimum)\n✓ Don't fear losing \"tenure\"—savings matter more\n✓ Get 3-5 quotes to compare (we do this for you)\n✓ Review coverage, not just price\n✓ Negotiate with current carrier using competitor quotes\n\nThe insurance you bought 5 years ago isn't the best deal today. Period.\n\nWant to know if you're overpaying? Drop your current premium in the comments (no personal info needed—just the number). I'll tell you if it's in the normal range for [STATE].\n\nOr DM me \"QUOTE\" and I'll run a comparison for you—takes 10 minutes, could save you $[AMOUNT]+.\n\nShare this with someone who hasn't shopped their insurance in years.
