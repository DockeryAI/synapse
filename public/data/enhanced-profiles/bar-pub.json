It takes showing up consistently, remembering names, and actually caring when regulars tell you about their week.\n\n2. You can't be everything to everyone. We're not the club. We're not the fancy cocktail bar. We're the place you go on a random Tuesday because you know it'll be good.\n\n3. Your staff makes or breaks the vibe. [BARTENDER NAME] has been here [NUMBER] years. [SERVER NAME] knows half the neighborhood by name. That's not training—that's culture.\n\n4. The little things matter more than the big things. Free popcorn. Remembering someone drinks Stella. Having the game on without being asked. Texting regulars when their favorite beer is back on tap.\n\n5. Authenticity beats marketing every time. We're not trying to go viral. We're trying to be here in 10 more years.\n\nTo everyone who's made this place what it is—thank you. You're not just customers.
