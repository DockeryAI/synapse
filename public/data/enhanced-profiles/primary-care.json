And yes, that's part of it.\n\nBut here's what REALLY prevents disease:\n\n✅ Blood pressure checks that catch hypertension before your first stroke\n✅ A1C tests that identify pre-diabetes when it's still reversible  \n✅ Colonoscopy that removes polyps before they become cancer\n✅ Medication reviews that prevent dangerous interactions\n✅ Depression screenings that get you help before crisis\n✅ Vaccine updates that prevent serious illness\n\nReal talk: I've seen too many patients who were \"healthy\" until suddenly they weren't. The heart attack at 52. The diabetes diagnosis with kidney damage already present. The cancer found too late.\n\nEvery single one said the same thing: \"I felt fine. I didn't think I needed to see a doctor.\"\n\nThat's the thing about prevention - it works BEFORE you feel sick.\n\nYour body gives subtle warnings. Primary care physicians are trained to hear them.\n\nThe patients who do best aren't the ones who come in with problems. They're the ones who come in to PREVENT problems.\n\n💭 What's stopping you from scheduling your preventive care?\n\nCost? We can discuss what's covered.\nTime?
