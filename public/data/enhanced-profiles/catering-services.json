This is the #1 concern we hear from thoughtful hosts.\n\nHere's our simple system that's worked for [NUMBER] events:\n\n1️⃣ ASK EARLY: Include dietary needs question on your RSVP or meeting invite. Don't wait until the week before.\n\n2️⃣ BE SPECIFIC: Don't just ask \"any dietary restrictions?\" List common ones: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, nut allergies, kosher, halal. People are more likely to respond when they see their need listed.\n\n3️⃣ PLAN FOR EXTRAS: Even if no one RSVPs with restrictions, include at least [NUMBER] vegetarian and [NUMBER] gluten-free options. Trust us—someone always forgot to mention it.\n\n4️⃣ LABEL EVERYTHING: Clear labels prevent the awkward \"what's in this?\" questions and help people serve themselves confidently.\n\n5️⃣ AVOID CROSS-CONTAMINATION: Separate serving utensils for each dish. It matters for allergies.\n\nThe result? Every guest feels welcomed and considered. No one goes hungry. You look like a thoughtful, organized host.\n\nWe build dietary accommodations into every menu at no extra charge because inclusive events are better events.\n\n💬 What dietary accommodations are you planning for your next event?

They're not just taking an order—they're planning with you.\n\n✅ THEY SHOW YOU PROOF: Real photos from real events they've done. Not stock images. Not photos from 2015.

You know exactly what's included and what costs extra.\n\n✅ THEY HAVE A BACKUP PLAN: What happens if their truck breaks down? If a staff member calls in sick? If your headcount suddenly changes?
