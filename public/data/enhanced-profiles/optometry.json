No pain. No vision loss. No warning signs.\n\nHere's why this matters:\n\n🔴 Glaucoma steals peripheral vision so gradually, most people don't notice until 40% is already gone\n🔴 Once vision is lost to glaucoma, it's permanent—we can only prevent further damage\n🔴 Early detection and treatment can prevent 95% of glaucoma blindness\n🔴 If caught early, simple eye drops can preserve your vision for life\n\nYour risk increases if you:\n✓ Are over 40\n✓ Have a family history of glaucoma\n✓ Are African American, Hispanic, or Asian\n✓ Have diabetes or high blood pressure\n✓ Are very nearsighted\n\nThe only way to detect early glaucoma is through a comprehensive eye exam with specialized testing. Not a vision screening. Not an online test. A real exam with imaging technology.\n\nI've had patients cry tears of relief when we catch it early.
