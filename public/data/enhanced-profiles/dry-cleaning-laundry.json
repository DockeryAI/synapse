Time to set the record straight!\n\nMYTH #1: \"More detergent = cleaner clothes\"\nREALITY: Extra detergent leaves residue that attracts MORE dirt. Your clothes get dirtier faster. Use half what you think you need.\n\nMYTH #2: \"Hot water kills all germs\"\nREALITY: Unless you're washing at 140°F+ (which destroys most fabrics), you're not killing much. Proper detergent matters more than temperature.\n\nMYTH #3: \"Dry cleaning uses harsh chemicals that damage clothes\"\nREALITY: Modern dry cleaning is gentler than home washing for most fabrics. It's literally called 'dry' because there's no water to cause shrinkage or color bleeding.\n\nMYTH #4: \"You should wash clothes after every wear\"\nREALITY: Over-washing is the #1 cause of premature wear. Unless it's visibly dirty or smells, most items can go 2-3 wears (except underwear and workout gear, obviously!).\n\nMYTH #5: \"That fresh laundry smell means it's clean\"\nREALITY: That's just fragrance. Truly clean laundry should smell like... nothing. If it smells like chemicals or perfume, there's residue left behind.\n\nWhat myths have YOU heard?

So here's what you NEED to know before trusting anyone with your expensive garments:\n\n🚩 RED FLAG #1: They don't inspect your item with you present\nReputable cleaners document every stain, missing button, and existing damage BEFORE cleaning. If they don't, you have zero recourse.\n\n🚩 RED FLAG #2: They can't explain their process\nAsk \"What method do you use for silk?\" If they can't give specifics, they're probably using one-size-fits-all treatment. That's how designer pieces get destroyed.\n\n🚩 RED FLAG #3: Prices seem too good to be true\nQuality cleaning costs money. Proper solvents, trained staff, and insurance aren't cheap. Rock-bottom prices mean corners are being cut.\n\n🚩 RED FLAG #4: No insurance or guarantee\nThings can go wrong even with experts. But professionals stand behind their work with actual insurance, not just \"we'll try our best.\"\n\n🚩 RED FLAG #5: They promise stain removal guarantees\nHonest cleaners say \"We'll do everything possible\" not \"100% guaranteed.\" Some stains ARE permanent, especially after improper home treatment.\n\nThe wedding dress I mentioned? The previous cleaner:\n✗ Used water on a water-soluble beaded fabric\n✗ Didn't test for colorfastness first\n✗ Had no insurance to cover the damage\n\nThe bride is devastated. Her dress is unwearable.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you—I'm trying to PROTECT you. Your clothes are investments.
