Let them explore without the pressure of an overnight. We'll assess temperament and you'll see them interact.\n\n2️⃣ COMFORT ITEMS\nPack their favorite blanket or toy (nothing irreplaceable). Familiar scents = instant comfort. We've seen anxiety drop 60% with a simple comfort item.\n\n3️⃣ MAINTAIN ROUTINE\nShare their exact schedule with us. Same feeding times, same commands, same bedtime routine. Consistency is everything.\n\n4️⃣ MEDICATION DISCUSSION  \nIf your vet recommended calming supplements, bring them. We administer all medications and track responses.\n\n5️⃣ TRUST THE PROCESS\nMost dogs adjust within 3-4 hours. We'll send you a photo when they settle in. [DOG NAME] was trembling at drop-off, playing happily by lunch (see photo!).\n\nThe transformation we see most:\nBEFORE: Owners crying at drop-off, dogs feeding off that energy\nAFTER: Quick goodbye, dog distracted by new friends, owner gets 'having a blast' photo within hours\n\nYour anxiety is normal.

Your dog needs attention, not just space.\n\n✅ TRANSPARENCY DRIVES LOYALTY  \n68% of our repeat clients cite \"real-time updates\" as their #1 reason for returning. Not price. Not location. Peace of mind.\n\n✅ TEMPERAMENT MATCHING PREVENTS 90% OF ISSUES\nWe separate by energy level AND size. A timid Labrador doesn't belong with high-energy terriers, regardless of size compatibility.\n\n✅ VET PARTNERSHIPS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE\nWhen [DOG NAME] showed early signs of bloat at 11pm, our vet tech recognized it and our partner clinic saw them within 20 minutes. That dog is alive because of protocols, not luck.\n\n✅ CERTIFICATION MATTERS\nOur entire team is [CERTIFICATION: Pet First Aid, Fear Free, etc.]. This isn't just dog-sitting—it's professional animal care.\n\nThe bottom line: You're not choosing between facilities. You're choosing between stress and peace of mind.\n\nWhat questions should you ask during a facility tour? Here are my top 5:\n1. What's your staff-to-dog ratio during overnight hours?\n2. How do you handle medical emergencies after hours?\n3. Can I see your play areas and sleeping quarters unannounced?\n4. What's your illness protocol and vaccination requirements?\n5. How and when will you contact me during the stay?\n\nIf they hesitate on any of these, walk away.\n\n[FACILITY NAME] offers free tours daily.
