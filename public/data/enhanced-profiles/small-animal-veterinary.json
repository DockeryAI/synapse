        "body": "Hi [OWNER NAME],\n\nDr. [VET NAME] here. I need to talk about something uncomfortable: money.\n\nFor years, our industry has avoided discussing costs until checkout. That needs to change.\n\nYou shouldn't have to guess what your pet's care will cost. You shouldn't feel ambushed by the bill. And you definitely shouldn't avoid bringing [PET NAME] in because you're scared of surprise charges.\n\n**Starting today, we're doing things differently:**\n\n✓ All procedure costs published on our website\n✓ Estimates provided BEFORE any treatment\n✓ Multiple treatment options at different price points\n✓ Payment plans available (CareCredit, Scratchpay)\n✓ No judgment, ever, about your budget\n\n**Here's what common procedures actually cost at [PRACTICE NAME]:**\n\n• Wellness exam: $[PRICE]\n• Dental cleaning: $[PRICE RANGE]\n• Spay/neuter: $[PRICE RANGE]\n• Emergency visit: $[PRICE] (exam) + treatment\n• Bloodwork panel: $[PRICE]\n\n[VIEW FULL PRICING button]\n\n**Why we're doing this:**\n\nBecause I've seen too many pet parents cry in the exam room - not because their pet is sick, but because they can't afford the care.\n\nBecause you deserve to make informed decisions.\n\nBecause transparency builds trust, and trust saves lives.\n\n**What this means for you:**\n\nNo more surprise bills. No more avoiding necessary care because you don't know the cost. Just honest conversations about what [PET NAME] needs and what fits your budget.\n\nThe \"best\" care is the care you can actually provide consistently.\n\nQuestions about costs for [PET NAME]'s care? Reply to this email or call [PHONE]. Let's talk openly.\n\nCommitted to transparency,\nDr. [VET NAME]\n\nP.S. If cost has ever stopped you from bringing [PET NAME] in, please reach out. We'll work with you to find a solution."
