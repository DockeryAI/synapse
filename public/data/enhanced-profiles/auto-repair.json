And yes, I own an auto repair shop.\n\nLet me explain (because this matters for your wallet AND your car):\n\nThe \"3,000-mile rule\" came from the 1960s-70s when:\n• Oil quality was terrible\n• Engines ran dirtier\n• Driving conditions were harsher\n\nToday? Modern synthetic oils + better engines = longer intervals.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOUR CAR ACTUALLY NEEDS:\n\n🚗 SYNTHETIC OIL: Every 7,500-10,000 miles (check your manual)\n🚗 CONVENTIONAL OIL: Every 5,000-7,500 miles\n🚗 SEVERE CONDITIONS: Every 3,000-5,000 miles\n\n\"Severe conditions\" means:\n• Mostly short trips (under 10 miles)\n• Stop-and-go city traffic\n• Extreme heat or cold\n• Towing or hauling\n• Dusty/dirty environments\n\nSo why do shops push 3,000 miles?\n\nHonestly? Because it's profitable. More frequent changes = more revenue.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'd rather have you as a customer for 10 years than squeeze an extra oil change out of you this year.\n\nWHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD:\n\n1. Check your owner's manual (it's in your glovebox)\n2. Look at the maintenance schedule\n3. Follow the \"severe\" schedule if you drive in city traffic\n4. Use quality oil (we use [BRAND])\n5. Keep records of your changes\n\nWe've been in [CITY] for [NUMBER] years because we tell you what you NEED, not what makes us the most money.\n\nYes, this post probably just cost me some revenue.
