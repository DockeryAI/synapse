Absolutely.\n\n---\n\n[FIRST_NAME],\n\nUnpopular opinion:\n\nIf you're working 70-hour weeks as an executive, you're doing it wrong.\n\nNot because you're not committed.\nNot because you're not talented.\n\nBecause you're confusing activity with impact.\n\nI've coached [NUMBER] executives through this exact transition:\n\nFROM: Being indispensable\nTO: Building an organization that doesn't need you to function\n\nFROM: Pride in being \"hands-on\"\nTO: Pride in your team's autonomy\n\nFROM: Doing the work\nTO: Ensuring the right work gets done\n\nThe executives who make this shift?\n→ Work fewer hours\n→ Have more impact\n→ Build stronger teams  \n→ Get promoted faster\n→ Sleep better at night\n\nThe executives who don't?\n→ Burn out\n→ Become bottlenecks\n→ Lose their best people\n→ Get passed over for the next level\n\nHere's the hard truth:\n\nEvery hour you spend doing work someone else could do is an hour you're NOT spending on work only you can do.\n\nYour job isn't to be the best player.\nIt's to build the best team.\n\nIf this resonates and you're ready to make the shift, let's talk.\n\nI'm opening [NUMBER] coaching spots for Q2. These are for executives facing critical transitions who need a structured framework, not just advice.\n\nReply with \"STRATEGIC\" and I'll send you the 3-question assessment I use in discovery calls.\n\n[YOUR_NAME]\n\nP.S.

Here's what to do first.\n\n---\n\n[FIRST_NAME],\n\nIf you're reading this, you're likely:\n\n→ 90 days into a new executive role and already feeling the gap\n→ Facing board pressure to improve leadership effectiveness  \n→ Dealing with team issues that won't resolve themselves\n→ Working insane hours and still falling behind\n\nAm I close?\n\nHere's what I know from coaching 100+ executives through this exact moment:\n\nYou don't need more advice.\nYou don't need another leadership book.\nYou don't need to \"figure it out\" on your own.\n\nYou need:\n✓ A proven framework for the transition you're facing\n✓ Someone who's guided others through your exact situation  \n✓ Structured accountability for the behaviors you know you need to change\n✓ A confidential space to pressure-test decisions\n✓ Pattern recognition you can't see from inside the situation\n\nThat's executive coaching.\n\nNot therapy. Not consulting. Not cheerleading.\n\nStructured transformation with measurable outcomes.\n\nRECENT EXAMPLE:\n[CLIENT_TITLE] - 90-day board ultimatum\nChallenge: Team exodus, micromanagement, strategic drift\nFramework: 6-month engagement, bi-weekly sessions, 360 feedback\nResult: Zero departures, board satisfaction +40%, promoted to CEO\n\nI have [NUMBER] spots opening for Q2.\n\nThese are for executives who:\n→ Are facing a critical transition or challenge\n→ Are coachable and ready to do the work  \n→ Understand that transformation takes commitment\n→ Value confidentiality and discretion\n\nIf that's you, let's schedule a 30-minute discovery call.\n\nNo pressure. No sales pitch. Just an honest conversation about whether coaching is right for you right now.\n\n[CALENDAR_LINK]\n\nOr reply to this email with your biggest leadership challenge and I'll send you a personalized framework.\n\nYour move,\n[YOUR_NAME]\n\nP.S.
