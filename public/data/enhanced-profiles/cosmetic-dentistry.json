If your dentist can't show you a digital preview or mock-up before you commit, that's a red flag. We use [TECHNOLOGY] so you see your new smile before we start.\n\n4️⃣ \"What if I hate the results?\"\nThis is why consultation matters. We spend [TIME] understanding exactly what you want—not just selling a procedure.

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nYou've been thinking about transforming your smile. Maybe for weeks. Maybe for years.\n\nBut here's what I see happen constantly: people book consultations without knowing what questions to ask. Then they leave confused, overwhelmed, or worse—they choose based on price alone.\n\nBefore you book anywhere (including with us), ask these 5 questions:\n\n1. \"Can I see before/after photos of patients with MY specific concern?\"\nGeneric smile galleries don't tell you if they can solve YOUR problem. Ask for cases similar to yours.\n\n2. \"What's your experience specifically with [PROCEDURE]?\"\nGeneral dentists can do cosmetic work. Cosmetic specialists do it every day. Experience matters.\n\n3. \"Can I see a preview before committing?\"\nDigital smile design shows you the result before you invest. If they can't show you, that's a red flag.\n\n4. \"What happens if I'm not happy with the results?\"\nUnderstand the guarantee, revision policy, and timeline before you start.\n\n5. \"What are my financing options?\"\nDon't let cost be a surprise. Practices should offer transparent pricing and payment plans upfront.\n\nBONUS QUESTION: \"How many appointments will this take?\"\nYour time matters. Know the commitment before you book.\n\n[FIRST_NAME], your smile transformation should be exciting, not stressful.\n\nWhen you're ready, here's what we offer:\n✓ Free consultation with digital smile preview\n✓ [NUMBER]+ years specializing in cosmetic cases\n✓ Transparent pricing with financing as low as $[AMOUNT]/month\n✓ [GUARANTEE/POLICY]\n✓ Complete transformation in [NUMBER] appointments\n\n[CTA BUTTON: Book Your Free Consultation]\n\nQuestions before booking? Just reply to this email.\n\nTo your confidence,\n[DENTIST NAME]\n[PRACTICE NAME]\n\nP.S. The patients who are happiest with their results? They're the ones who asked great questions upfront. Be that person.",

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nYesterday, someone offered me $15,000 for a smile makeover.\n\nI said no.\n\nNot because I didn't want the business. But because she wanted results in 2 weeks for her wedding, and I knew I couldn't deliver the quality she deserved in that timeline.\n\nShe was frustrated. I get it.\n\nBut here's what I've learned in [NUMBER] years of cosmetic dentistry:\n\nRushed work = regretted results.\n\nThe best smile transformations take time because:\n\n→ Custom lab work can't be rushed without compromising quality\n→ Your gums need time to heal between appointments for optimal aesthetics  \n→ We need multiple try-ins to ensure you LOVE the result before it's permanent\n\nI've seen too many people come to me trying to fix rushed work from other practices:\n\n\"They promised me results in one appointment. Now my veneers look fake and I hate them.\"\n\n\"I needed it done before my reunion. They rushed it. Now I'm stuck with chiclet teeth.\"\n\n\"The price was great and the timeline was fast. But I look like I'm wearing someone else's smile.\"\n\n[FIRST_NAME], I'm not telling you this to scare you.\n\nI'm telling you this because you deserve to know what quality actually requires.\n\nIf you have an event coming up, let's talk NOW about realistic timelines:\n\n→ [PROCEDURE]: [TIMEFRAME] for optimal results\n→ [PROCEDURE]: [TIMEFRAME] with proper healing\n→ [PROCEDURE]: [TIMEFRAME] including custom lab work\n\nI'd rather tell you \"we need more time\" than deliver something you'll regret.\n\nYour smile is permanent. The event is temporary.\n\nLet's do this right.\n\n[CTA BUTTON: Schedule Your Consultation]\n\nCommitted to your best result,\n[DENTIST NAME]\n[PRACTICE NAME]\n\nP.S. If you DO have an upcoming event, book now. The earlier we start, the better your results will be. But I'll never sacrifice quality for speed.",
