        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nI need to tell you something:\n\nEvery single week, a parent sits in my office and apologizes for needing childcare.\n\n\"I wish I could stay home, but...\"\n\"I feel terrible leaving them with strangers...\"\n\"My mother thinks I'm being selfish...\"\n\nStop.\n\nYou are not a bad parent for working. You are not damaging your child.
