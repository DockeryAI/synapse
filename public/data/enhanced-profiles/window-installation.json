That's $200/month. $2,400/year. Every single year.\n\nHere's what's actually happening:\n\n🔴 Condensation between panes = seal failure (argon gas escaped years ago)\n🔴 Drafts around frames = air leakage equivalent to a 2-foot hole in your wall\n🔴 Single-pane or old double-pane = R-value of 1-2 (modern windows are R-5 to R-7)\n\nTHE SOLUTION ISN'T COMPLICATED:\n\nNew energy-efficient windows typically pay for themselves in 6-8 years through energy savings alone. Plus:\n✅ Federal tax credit covers 30% (up to $1,200) - but only through Dec 31, 2024\n✅ Utility company rebates (check [LOCAL UTILITY] website)\n✅ Increased home value ($1.50 return for every $1 spent)\n✅ Better sleep (noise reduction is REAL)\n✅ No more painting rotted frames every year\n\nI created a simple calculator to show YOUR potential savings based on your home size and current windows. Comment 'CALCULATOR' below and I'll send it to you.\n\nQuestions? Ask away!

For 10 windows, you're at $6,740-8,990 when you thought you'd pay $2,990.\n\nHERE'S HOW WE DO IT DIFFERENTLY:\n\nFull project pricing. One number. Everything included:\n✅ Premium [BRAND] windows (your choice of styles)\n✅ Professional installation with lifetime labor warranty\n✅ All trim work (interior and exterior)\n✅ Insulation and sealing\n✅ Permits and inspections\n✅ Debris removal and cleanup\n✅ Post-installation energy verification\n\nNo surprises. No upsells. No \"oh, by the way\" charges.\n\nWHY AM I POSTING THIS?\n\nBecause I'm tired of fixing botched jobs from companies that low-balled the price, then cut corners to make their margin. I've seen:\n- Windows installed without proper flashing (hello water damage)\n- High-expansion foam that warped the frames\n- Vinyl windows in historic homes (seriously?)\n- \"Lifetime warranties\" from companies that disappeared in 2 years\n\nYou deserve better. [CITY] homeowners deserve better.\n\nIf you're getting quotes, ask these questions:\n1. \"Is this the TOTAL project cost?\"\n2. \"What's included in your labor warranty?\"\n3. \"Can I see photos of jobs in my neighborhood?\"\n4. \"Will you provide pre- and post-installation moisture readings?\"\n5. \"How long have you been in business at this location?\"\n\nShare this with someone who's shopping for windows.
