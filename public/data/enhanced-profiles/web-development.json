They're spending money on ads, doing SEO, creating great content... but their website is sabotaging everything.\n\nThe 5 silent conversion killers (and how to fix them):\n\n🔴 PROBLEM #1: Unoptimized Images\nYour high-res photos are beautiful but they're adding 3+ seconds to load time.\n✅ Fix: Compress images to under 200KB, use WebP format, implement lazy loading\n\n🔴 PROBLEM #2: Too Many Plugins/Scripts\nEvery plugin, tracking code, and widget adds load time.\n✅ Fix: Audit and remove anything you don't absolutely need. Combine scripts where possible.\n\n🔴 PROBLEM #3: No Caching\nRepeat visitors are waiting the same amount of time as first-timers.\n✅ Fix: Implement browser caching and server-side caching. Huge impact.\n\n🔴 PROBLEM #4: Cheap Hosting\nThat $5/month hosting can't handle your traffic.\n✅ Fix: Upgrade to quality hosting with SSD drives and CDN. Worth every penny.\n\n🔴 PROBLEM #5: Bloated Code\nDIY website builders add tons of unnecessary code.\n✅ Fix: Clean, custom code or optimized WordPress themes. Makes a massive difference.\n\nREAL EXAMPLE:\nWe worked with a local [INDUSTRY] business whose site was taking 6.2 seconds to load. Their bounce rate was 78%. They were getting traffic but zero conversions.\n\nWe optimized their site (didn't even redesign it):\n→ Load time: 6.2s to 0.8s\n→ Bounce rate: 78% to 23%\n→ Conversion rate: 5% to 18%\n\nSame traffic.

You see the green checkmark. You think you're good.\n\nBut here's what Google's test DOESN'T tell you:\n\n❌ Your mobile site loads 2.3x slower than desktop\n❌ Your buttons are too small to tap accurately\n❌ Your forms are a nightmare on phones\n❌ Your images are sized for desktop, crushing mobile data\n❌ Your navigation requires 4 taps to find anything\n\nThe data from my analysis:\n→ Average mobile load time: 4.8 seconds (desktop: 2.1 seconds)\n→ Mobile conversion rate: 1.9% (desktop: 5.2%)\n→ Mobile bounce rate: 71% (desktop: 43%)\n\nTranslation: Your mobile site is costing you 2-3x more customers than your desktop site.\n\nHere's a real example that blew my mind:\n\nLocal [INDUSTRY] business came to me.

It was built for desktop and adapted for mobile.\n\nWe rebuilt it mobile-FIRST (desktop second):\n\n✅ Touch-optimized buttons (minimum 44x44 pixels)\n✅ Single-column layouts (no pinch-to-zoom)\n✅ Images compressed for cellular connections\n✅ Simplified navigation (thumb-friendly)\n✅ One-tap phone/email actions\n✅ Forms reduced from 8 fields to 3\n\n90 days later, the results:\n→ Mobile conversion rate: 1.8% to 14.2%\n→ Mobile load time: 4.2s to 0.9s\n→ Mobile revenue: +340%\n→ Average mobile session: 0:47 to 3:22\n\nSame traffic. Different approach. Completely different results.\n\nThe shift in thinking:\n🔴 OLD: \"How do we make our desktop site work on mobile?\"\n🟢 NEW: \"How do we create the best mobile experience, then enhance for desktop?\"\n\nBecause here's the reality: 65-75% of your traffic is mobile. Your mobile site ISN'T a secondary experience. It's THE experience.\n\nQuick test: Pull out your phone right now. Go to your website. Try to:\n→ Find your phone number and call it\n→ Fill out your contact form\n→ Navigate to your services page\n\nIf any of that feels clunky, frustrating, or slow... you're losing customers every single day.\n\nWant me to do a free mobile experience audit of your site?

        "body": "Hey [FIRST_NAME],\n\nQuick question: How long does your website take to load?\n\nIf you don't know the answer, that's a problem.\n\nIf the answer is \"more than 2 seconds,\" that's a BIGGER problem.\n\nHere's why:\n\nFor every second of load time, you lose 7% of visitors. Most small business sites take 5-6 seconds to load. That means you're losing 40% of potential customers before they even see your content.\n\nAt [AVERAGE_TRAFFIC] monthly visitors and a [AVERAGE_VALUE] customer value, that's $[DOLLAR_AMOUNT] walking away every month.\n\nThe 5 silent conversion killers:\n\n1. Unoptimized images (adding 3+ seconds)\n2. Too many plugins/scripts (each one slows you down)\n3. No caching (repeat visitors wait just as long)\n4. Cheap hosting (can't handle your traffic)\n5. Bloated code (DIY builders are the worst offenders)\n\nThe good news? Most of these are fixable without a complete redesign.\n\nReal example:\n[CLIENT_NAME] came to us with a 6.2-second load time. We optimized their site (same design, better performance).\n\nResults:\n→ Load time: 6.2s to 0.8s\n→ Bounce rate: 78% to 23%\n→ Conversion rate: 5% to 18%\n\nSame traffic. Same budget. 3x the results.\n\nWant to know what's slowing YOUR site down?\n\nReply to this email with your website URL and I'll run a free performance audit. I'll send you a detailed report showing:\n\n✅ Your current load time\n✅ What's slowing you down\n✅ Specific fixes prioritized by impact\n✅ Estimated improvement potential\n\nNo obligation. No sales pitch. Just actionable insights you can use.\n\nFirst 10 responses get priority (I'm doing these personally).\n\nYour website should be working FOR you, not against you.\n\nLet's fix that.\n\n[YOUR_NAME]\n[YOUR_COMPANY]\n\nP.S. - If you want to test it yourself first, use Google PageSpeed Insights (it's free).
