Here's why that's costing you money:\n\n• Sunlight breaks down chlorine within 2 hours\n• You're literally watching your money evaporate\n• The algae comes back because the shock never had time to work\n• You end up using 2-3x more chemicals than necessary\n\n✅ The Fix: Always shock after sunset\n\nWhen you shock at night:\n→ Chlorine works for 8+ hours without sun degradation\n→ You use 60% less chemicals\n→ Algae actually dies instead of just getting stunned\n→ Water stays clear 3x longer\n\nBonus tip: Run your filter for 24 hours after shocking for maximum effectiveness.\n\n💰 This one change saves the average pool owner $200-300 per season in wasted chemicals.\n\nDrop a 💡 if you've been shocking during the day—you're definitely not alone!
