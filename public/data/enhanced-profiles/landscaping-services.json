Water droplets act as magnifying glasses in direct sun\n\n✅ OPTIMAL WINDOW (4-7 AM): Minimal evaporation, grass blades dry before nightfall (prevents fungus), soil absorption maximized\n\nBUT HERE'S THE THING...\n\nEven perfect timing won't fix these issues:\n- Compacted soil (water runs off instead of absorbing)\n- Wrong grass type for your sun exposure\n- Thatch buildup blocking water penetration\n- Shallow root systems from inconsistent watering\n\nI see so many [CITY] homeowners spending hundreds on their water bill, running sprinklers constantly, and still having brown patches.\n\nIt's not about more water.
