Their server crashed during [BUSY_PERIOD]. Down for [NUMBER] days. Lost $[AMOUNT] in revenue.

Now I spend [NUMBER] hours per month in a strategic meeting planning how technology can help us grow. That time alone is worth more than the monthly fee.\"\n\nThe ROI in [TIME_PERIOD]:\n→ Prevented [NUMBER] potential outages (estimated $[AMOUNT] saved)\n→ Eliminated surprise IT bills (saved $[AMOUNT])\n→ Recovered [NUMBER] hours of CEO time monthly (value: priceless)\n→ Passed cyber insurance audit (reduced premiums by $[AMOUNT])\n\nTotal documented savings: $[AMOUNT]\nMonthly investment: $[AMOUNT]\nNet benefit: $[AMOUNT] + peace of mind\n\n[CLIENT_NAME]'s advice to other business owners?\n\n\"Stop thinking about IT as an expense. It's insurance against disaster and an investment in growth. The question isn't 'can I afford managed IT?' It's 'can I afford NOT to have it?'\"\n\n---\n\nWe're currently onboarding [NUMBER] new clients this quarter.
