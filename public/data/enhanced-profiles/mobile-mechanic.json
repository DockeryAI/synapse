Two of them fixed it themselves with this checklist:\n\n✅ STEP 1: Check the obvious stuff\n• Is the car in Park? (sounds dumb, but happens daily)\n• Is the battery terminal corroded or loose? Wiggle it.\n• Are your headlights bright or dim when you turn the key?\n\n✅ STEP 2: Listen to what happens\n• Click-click-click = Dead/weak battery (90% of the time)\n• Nothing at all = Battery connection or starter\n• Engine cranks but won't fire = Fuel or ignition issue\n• Grinding noise = Starter going bad\n\n✅ STEP 3: Try this\nIf you hear clicking: Ask a neighbor for a jump start. If it starts, your battery is done. If it doesn't start even with a jump, it's your starter or alternator.\n\n💡 PRO TIP: If your car is 3+ years old and you've never replaced the battery, it's living on borrowed time. Batteries typically last 3-5 years in [REGION] climate.\n\n🔧 When to call us:\n• You tried all this and still stuck\n• You don't have jumper cables or a helpful neighbor\n• It started with a jump but you need a new battery installed\n• You want a professional diagnostic to be sure\n\nWe come to you for battery testing and replacement - usually have you running in under an hour.

They can only void your warranty if they prove that independent service caused the specific problem.\n\n✅ WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:\n• You can get oil changes anywhere\n• You can use quality aftermarket parts\n• You can choose independent mechanics\n• Your warranty stays intact as long as proper maintenance is documented\n\n🔍 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:\n• Keep all service records\n• Use quality parts that meet manufacturer specs\n• Follow the maintenance schedule in your owner's manual\n• Get receipts that show what was done\n\nI've been a mobile mechanic for [NUMBER] years and have serviced hundreds of cars under warranty. Never once has a manufacturer successfully voided a warranty because the owner used our service instead of the dealer.\n\nThe dealer service department charges 40-60% more than independent mechanics for the same work.

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nThat check engine light causes more panic than it should. Here's what I tell every customer:\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS:\n\n🔴 SOLID LIGHT = Something's wrong, but not urgent\n• You have days/weeks to address it\n• Usually emissions-related\n• Won't damage engine immediately\n• Get it diagnosed within a week\n\n🔴 FLASHING LIGHT = STOP DRIVING NOW\n• Active misfire happening\n• Can damage catalytic converter ($2,000+ part)\n• Pull over safely and call for service\n• This is the actual emergency\n\nMOST COMMON CAUSES (in order):\n\n1. Loose/faulty gas cap - $0-$25\n2. Oxygen sensor - $150-$300\n3. Catalytic converter - $800-$2,500\n4. Mass airflow sensor - $200-$400\n5. Spark plugs/coils - $100-$400\n\nWHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:\n\n✓ Tighten your gas cap (seriously, try this first)\n✓ Note if you feel any performance changes\n✓ Check if the light is solid or flashing\n✓ Don't ignore it for months (small problems become big ones)\n\nWE DIAGNOSE IN YOUR DRIVEWAY:\n• Free diagnostic with any repair\n• Tell you exactly what's wrong before we touch anything\n• Show you the problem (not just a code)\n• Give you options, not pressure\n\n[CTA BUTTON: Schedule Free Diagnostic]\n\nGot a check engine light on right now? Reply with your car's symptoms and I'll give you my best guess before we even schedule.\n\nThe worst thing you can do? Ignore it and hope it goes away. The second worst? Pay $150 for a shop diagnostic when we do it free.\n\n[SIGNATURE]\n[NAME]\nASE Certified Mobile Mechanic\n[PHONE] | Serving [CITY]\n\nP.S. - AutoZone will scan your code for free, but they can't tell you what it MEANS.
