Here's what's actually happening:\n\nMice can fit through a hole the size of a DIME. One pregnant female = 50+ mice in 3 months.\n\nWhat that scratching really means:\n→ They're nesting in your insulation (ruins it)\n→ Chewing electrical wires (fire hazard - not exaggerating)\n→ Leaving droppings that spread disease\n→ Getting into your food storage\n\nThe WORST thing you can do? Ignore it and hope it goes away. It won't.\n\nThe SECOND worst thing? Use poison without sealing entry points. Dead mice in your walls = horrible smell for weeks.\n\nWhat actually works:\n1. Find and seal EVERY entry point (this is 80% of the solution)\n2. Trap existing mice humanely\n3. Clean and sanitize affected areas\n4. Monitor to ensure they're gone\n\nDIY works for 1-2 mice. If you're hearing them every night, it's beyond that.\n\nWe're offering free inspections this week because I'd rather you know what you're dealing with than guess.
