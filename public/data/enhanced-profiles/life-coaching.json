Great career, good life, but completely unfulfilled.\n\nFirst session, I asked her one question. She sat silent for 3 full minutes.\n\nThen she started crying.\n\nThe question?\n\n\"What would you do if you knew no one would judge you?\"\n\nHere's why it works:\n\nMost people aren't stuck because they don't know what they want. They're stuck because they're afraid to want it.\n\nThey've spent so long living for others' approval that they've lost touch with their own desires.\n\nSo here's your homework (if you're brave enough):\n\nGrab a journal. Set a timer for 10 minutes. Answer that question without censoring yourself.\n\nNo one has to see it. No one has to know.\n\nJust you and the truth.\n\nWhat would you do if no one would judge you?\n\nThe answer might surprise you. It might scare you. It might change everything.\n\nThat's the point.\n\nYour move,\n[YOUR NAME]\n\nP.S. [CLIENT NAME] quit her corporate job 6 weeks later and started the business she'd been dreaming about for 5 years. Sometimes one question is all it takes to unlock everything.\n\n---\n\nFRAMEWORK: PAS (Problem: stuck and unfulfilled, Agitate: fear of judgment, Solution: the question)\nLENGTH: ~200 words\nTONE: Personal, vulnerable, actionable",

This doesn't.\n\n---\n\n[FIRST_NAME],\n\nControversial take:\n\nI don't want motivated clients anymore.\n\nI want COMMITTED ones.\n\nHere's the difference:\n\nMotivated people start strong. They're excited, energized, ready to change everything.\n\nThen life happens. The motivation fades. They quit.\n\nCommitted people? They keep going when motivation disappears.\n\nThey don't need to 'feel like it' to show up. They show up because they decided to.\n\nAfter [NUMBER] years coaching, I've learned:\n\nTransformation doesn't happen in the motivated moments. It happens in the mundane ones.\n\nIt's the Tuesday morning when you don't feel like it but you do it anyway.\nIt's the boundary you set even though it's uncomfortable.\nIt's the hard conversation you have instead of avoiding it.\n\nThat's commitment.\n\nAnd commitment is what changes lives.\n\nSo if you're waiting to 'feel ready' before you invest in yourself?\nIf you're waiting for the 'perfect time' to make a change?\nIf you're waiting for motivation to strike?\n\nYou'll be waiting forever.\n\nThe people who transform are the ones who commit before they're ready.\n\nThey feel the fear and do it anyway.\n\nAre you motivated or committed?\n\nThere's only one right answer if you actually want to change.\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n\nP.S. I have [NUMBER] coaching spots opening [MONTH]. I only work with people who are committed, not just curious.

You don't need another course.\n\nYou need someone who's been where you are. Someone who gets it. Someone who can see the patterns you can't see from inside your own life.\n\nThat's what coaching is.\n\nNot therapy (though that's valuable too).\nNot consulting (I'm not going to tell you what to do).\nNot a magic fix (this requires your commitment).\n\nIt's a partnership to help you:\n→ Get clarity on what you actually want\n→ Identify the patterns keeping you stuck\n→ Build the courage to change\n→ Create accountability so you actually do it\n\nI'm opening [NUMBER] spots for [MONTH] for 1:1 coaching.\n\nThis is for you if:\n✓ You're ready to invest in yourself (time AND money)\n✓ You're willing to be uncomfortable\n✓ You're done waiting for permission\n✓ You want results, not just conversations\n\nWhat you get:\n→ [NUMBER] weeks of 1:1 coaching\n→ Personalized roadmap for YOUR transformation\n→ Voxer access between sessions\n→ Tools and frameworks you'll use forever\n\nInvestment: [PRICE] (payment plans available)\n\nInterested?\n\nReply to this email with 'READY' and I'll send you the details + application.\n\nYour future self is waiting.
