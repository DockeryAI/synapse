        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nMary's orthopedic surgeon scheduled her knee replacement for 8 weeks out.\n\nShe was 62, couldn't walk to her mailbox, and felt she had no choice.\n\nBEFORE:\n\"I couldn't tie my own shoes without shooting pain. I thought my active life was over. Surgery terrified me, but what else could I do?\"\n\nThat's when she called us for a second opinion.\n\nAFTER:\n12 weeks later:\n✓ Surgery postponed indefinitely\n✓ Completed her first 5K\n✓ Hiking with grandkids\n✓ Zero pain medication\n✓ Full return to gardening\n\n\"I tell everyone: try PT before surgery. [COMPANY] literally gave me my life back.\"\n\nTHE BRIDGE:\nWhat changed?\n\nWe didn't just treat her knee. We found the ROOT CAUSE:\n→ Weak hips creating uneven knee pressure\n→ Movement patterns damaging her joint\n→ Muscle imbalances\n→ Nervous system stuck in pain mode\n\nOur [PROPRIETARY METHOD] protocol addressed all of it.\n\nThe result? No surgery needed.\n\nMary isn't unique. We've helped [NUMBER]% of surgical candidates avoid or delay procedures this year.\n\nARE YOU FACING SURGERY?\n\nKnee, hip, shoulder, back—whatever it is, you deserve to know ALL your options before going under the knife.\n\nWe're offering [NUMBER] Complimentary Surgical Alternative Consultations this month (normally $[AMOUNT]).\n\nYou'll get:\n✓ Comprehensive movement assessment\n✓ Honest evaluation: Can PT help YOU specifically?\n✓ Personalized treatment plan\n✓ No pressure, just education\n\nWe'll tell you the truth—whether conservative care can help or if surgery is your best path.\n\n[CTA BUTTON: Claim Your Free Consultation]\n\nOnly [NUMBER] spots available.\nMust book by [DATE].\n\nQualify if you:\n→ Have been told you need surgery\n→ Want to explore all options first\n→ Are willing to commit to the process\n\nYour future mobility is worth 60 minutes of your time.\n\n[THERAPIST NAME], PT, DPT\n[COMPANY NAME]\n[PHONE] | [WEBSITE]\n\nP.S.
