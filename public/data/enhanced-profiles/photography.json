And goes.\n\nThe problem? Your kids won't remember what you looked like during these years. Not really.\n\nThey'll have photos of themselves. But not WITH you.\n\nHere's the truth that changed how I approach family photography:\n\nYour kids don't care if you're 15 pounds heavier or having a bad hair day.\n\nThey care that you were there. That you're in the frame with them.\n\nSo here's my challenge:\n\nBook a family session. Not \"someday.\" Not \"when we lose weight\" or \"after we redecorate.\"\n\nNow. This season. This version of your family.\n\nBecause this exact moment—these ages, these smiles, this season—it's already disappearing.\n\n[MONTH] family sessions are open.
