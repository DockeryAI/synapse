They don't have unlimited time—they need efficient 20-minute practice routines.\n\nThe Agitate:\nWhen adults feel patronized or see no progress toward songs they actually care about, they quit. That dusty guitar in the corner? That's a failed student relationship.\n\nThe Solution:\n✓ Start with song-based learning, not theory-first approaches\n✓ Set micro-milestones: 'Play the chorus by week 3'\n✓ Acknowledge time constraints—design around them\n✓ Celebrate small wins publicly\n\nI've seen retention rates jump from 35% to 78% when we restructured our adult programs around these principles.\n\nWhat's your experience teaching adult learners?

[CURRENT_SONG] - just the chorus, 2 times\n2. [SCALE/EXERCISE] - once through, focus on [TECHNIQUE]\n3. [FUN_SONG] - their choice, play for fun\n\nWhy this works:\n✅ Clear finish line (not watching the clock)\n✅ Mixes challenge with reward\n✅ Takes 15-20 mins but feels focused\n✅ Kid has some control (song #3)\n✅ You can actually hear if it's done\n\nBonus: When they finish all 3, they often keep playing the fun song because... they're actually enjoying it.\n\nTry it this week and report back!
