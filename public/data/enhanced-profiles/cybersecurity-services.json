They paid it. Still lost 3 weeks of operations and 2 major clients.\n\nHere's what ACTUALLY stops attacks (from analyzing 1,000+ incidents):\n\n1️⃣ **Employee Security Training** - 93% of breaches start with email. Your team is your first defense.\n\n2️⃣ **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Stolen passwords are useless if hackers need your phone too.\n\n3️⃣ **Automated Backup Testing** - Backups don't matter if they don't actually work when you need them.\n\n4️⃣ **24/7 Network Monitoring** - Hackers work at 2 AM. Does your security?\n\n5️⃣ **Incident Response Plan** - Chaos costs money. Having a plan cuts recovery time by 60%.\n\nReal example: [INDUSTRY] company in [CITY] implemented #4 last month.

        "body": "**SUBJECT:** 🚨 [FIRSTNAME], 60% of breached companies fail within 6 months\n**PREVIEW:** The 5 controls that stop 94% of attacks (most companies are missing #3)\n\n---\n\nHi [FIRSTNAME],\n\nLet me be direct: If you're relying on just antivirus and a firewall, you're not protected.\n\n**THE PROBLEM:**\n60% of companies hit with ransomware go out of business within 6 months. Average breach cost? $4.35M. And here's what keeps me up at night on your behalf—hackers need 10 minutes to compromise a network, but the average company takes 60 DAYS to even detect it.\n\nThat's an 8,640x gap.\n\n**THE AGITATION:**\nI reviewed 1,000+ breach reports last quarter. You know what I found? 93% of those companies thought they were \"adequately protected.\" They had security tools. They had IT people. They still got hit.\n\nWhy? Because they were missing critical controls that actually stop modern attacks.\n\n**THE SOLUTION:**\nHere are the 5 security controls that prevent 94% of breaches:\n\n**1. Security Awareness Training**\n→ 93% of breaches start with phishing emails\n→ Your employees are your first line of defense\n→ Monthly simulated phishing tests + training\n\n**2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  \n→ Stolen passwords become useless\n→ Blocks 99.9% of automated attacks\n→ Takes 15 minutes to implement\n\n**3. 24/7 Network Monitoring**\n→ Detects threats in under 10 minutes\n→ Automated response stops attacks instantly\n→ Most companies are missing THIS one\n\n**4. Tested Backup & Recovery**\n→ Backups don't matter if they don't work\n→ Weekly automated testing required\n→ 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 formats, 1 offsite\n\n**5. Incident Response Plan**\n→ Chaos costs millions in downtime\n→ Documented procedures cut recovery time 60%\n→ Quarterly tabletop exercises\n\n**REAL EXAMPLE:**\n[COMPANY TYPE] in [INDUSTRY] implemented control #3 last month. Caught ransomware attempt in 8 minutes. Zero damage. Zero downtime. Zero ransom paid.\n\nWithout monitoring? They estimated $2.1M in losses and 3 weeks of downtime.\n\n**YOUR NEXT STEP:**\nI created a free Security Control Assessment—takes 5 minutes, shows you exactly which of these 5 controls you have (and which gaps are putting you at risk).\n\n[TAKE THE 5-MINUTE ASSESSMENT →]\n\nNo sales pitch.
