Customers typically commit within 72 hours of quote when safety concerns exist, extending to 2 weeks for preventive replacement.",

It WILL blow out, usually at the worst possible time. Not repairable—needs immediate replacement.\n\n2️⃣ ALIGNMENT PULL  \nDoes your car pull left or right now? That pothole knocked your alignment off. Ignoring it will wear your new tires unevenly and cost you $[AMOUNT] in premature replacement.\n\n3️⃣ VIBRATION AT SPEED\nShaking steering wheel over 50mph?
