Know Your Audience:\n□ What's their biggest pain point?\n□ What language do they use? (not what YOU call it)\n□ Where do they watch videos? (LinkedIn? YouTube? TikTok?)\n□ What objections do they have?\n\n3. Gather Your Assets:\n□ Logo files (vector format)\n□ Brand guidelines/colors\n□ Existing footage (if any)\n□ Product photos\n□ Customer testimonials\n\n4. Set Realistic Expectations:\n□ Budget range: $5K-$15K for professional quality\n□ Timeline: 4-6 weeks minimum\n□ Revisions: 2 rounds is standard\n□ Distribution: Video is only half the battle\n\n5. Success Metrics:\n□ How will you measure ROI?\n□ What's your target view count?\n□ What action should viewers take?\n\nMost failed video projects skip step 1 and 2. Don't be most projects.\n\nQuestions? Drop them in the comments.

Platform-Specific Content\nStop uploading the same 5-minute video everywhere. LinkedIn audiences want 90 seconds. TikTok wants 15. YouTube wants 8 minutes with chapters. We create 5 versions from one shoot.\n\n2. Customer Language, Not Corporate Speak\nIf your customers say \"I'm worried we'll waste money,\" your video should say exactly that. Not \"ensuring optimal ROI alignment.\"\n\n3. Specific Numbers, Not Vague Claims\n\"Increased conversions\" = meh\n\"347% increase in demo requests in 60 days\" = credible\n\n4. Distribution Strategy > Production Quality\nA $5K video with a $10K distribution plan beats a $50K video with zero promotion. Every. Single. Time.\n\n5. Speed to Market\nYour competitor launched their product video 3 weeks ago. Yours is still in \"final revisions.\" Guess who's winning?\n\n❌ WHAT DOESN'T WORK:\n\n• Starting with your company history\n• Features without benefits\n• Stock footage of people pointing at screens\n• 6-month production timelines\n• No clear call-to-action\n• Ignoring mobile optimization\n\nWe just completed a benchmark study of 500+ B2B videos.
