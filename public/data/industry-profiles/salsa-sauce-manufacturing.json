Inconsistent quality batch-to-batch\n2. Flavor profile didn't match their authentic [CUISINE TYPE] concept\n3. Cost structure made it their third-highest food expense\n\nThey'd tried making it in-house, but labor costs and consistency issues across locations made it unsustainable.\n\nOUR APPROACH:\n\nWe structured a custom manufacturing partnership:\n\nPhase 1 - Recipe Development ([TIMEFRAME]):\n• Analyzed their existing recipe and customer feedback\n• Conducted [NUMBER] test batches with their culinary team\n• Developed formulation using [SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS] from [SOURCE]\n• Achieved target pH of [NUMBER] for [SHELF LIFE] refrigerated stability\n\nPhase 2 - Production Setup ([TIMEFRAME]):\n• Established [PRODUCTION SCHEDULE]\n• Implemented [QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS]\n• Created [PACKAGING SOLUTION] for their distribution needs\n• Set up [DELIVERY/LOGISTICS ARRANGEMENT]\n\nPhase 3 - Scaling ([TIMEFRAME]):\n• Increased from [INITIAL VOLUME] to [CURRENT VOLUME] weekly\n• Added [SECOND PRODUCT] to the partnership\n• Integrated [TECHNOLOGY/SYSTEM] for seamless ordering\n\nTHE RESULTS:\n\n→ 43% reduction in per-unit cost vs. previous supplier\n→ [CONSISTENCY METRIC] across all batches (verified through their QA testing)\n→ [CUSTOMER SATISFACTION METRIC] improvement in guest surveys\n→ Freed up [NUMBER] labor hours weekly across their locations\n→ Enabled menu expansion with [NEW ITEM] using the same salsa base\n\nKEY INSIGHTS:\n\nWhat made this work:\n\n• Collaborative recipe development rather than off-the-shelf product\n• Transparent cost structure aligned with their growth\n• Flexible production scheduling during their seasonal peaks\n• Direct communication channel for adjustments\n\nThe partnership has now expanded to [ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS/SERVICES].\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY:\n\nFor restaurant groups and food service operators, custom manufacturing partnerships offer a middle path between in-house production and commodity suppliers.
