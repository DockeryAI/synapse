ORDERING TOO EARLY (OR TOO LATE)\nThe sweet spot? [TIMEFRAME] before your event. Earlier = storage headaches. Later = limited inventory and rush fees. For [EVENT_TYPE], we recommend confirming [SPECIFIC_TIMING].\n\n2. IGNORING LOAD-IN RESTRICTIONS\n[PERCENTAGE]% of venue delays happen because rental trucks can't access loading docks during [TIME_RESTRICTIONS]. Always confirm: elevator dimensions, dock hours, and [VENUE_SPECIFIC_CONSIDERATION].\n\n3. UNDERESTIMATING SPACE REQUIREMENTS\n[FURNITURE_ITEM] looks compact in the warehouse. In your venue? Each [SPECIFIC_ITEM] needs [SQUARE_FOOTAGE] including clearance. We provide CAD layouts for events over [GUEST_COUNT] to prevent costly day-of surprises.\n\n4. MIXING RENTAL VENDORS\nYou save [DOLLAR_AMOUNT] using separate companies for [ITEM_CATEGORY_1] and [ITEM_CATEGORY_2]. But you lose [TIME_AMOUNT] coordinating deliveries and troubleshooting mismatches. Single-source rentals reduce your coordination time by [PERCENTAGE]%.\n\n5.
