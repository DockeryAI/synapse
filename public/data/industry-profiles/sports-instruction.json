Here's what I can tell you: I've worked with athletes at every level, from complete beginners to [LEVEL], and I've seen consistent improvement when athletes show up and apply what we work on. What I can't guarantee is overnight transformation or that your athlete will become a professional. What I CAN guarantee is that we'll identify the specific technical or mental barriers holding them back, create a clear development plan, and give them the tools to improve.

My job isn't to contradict what they're learning at practice; it's to help them master those skills faster and execute them better. I focus on the individual technique and fundamentals that make everything else click. Many team coaches actually appreciate when players get individual instruction because it means they come to practice more skilled and coachable. If you'd like, I'm happy to communicate with your team coach about what we're working on to ensure we're aligned. Think of me as the supplement to their team coaching, not a replacement.",
