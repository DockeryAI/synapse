Our fees are typically [X]% of construction cost, but we routinely save clients [Y]% through efficient design, competitive bidding, and construction oversight.

I'm the expert on translating that into buildable, code-compliant, efficient design. My job is to hear what you're trying to achieve and solve for that - not impose my aesthetic. That said, I will push back if I see you heading toward a solution that won't actually work or will create new problems. Think of me as a translator and problem-solver, not a dictator.

For a simple addition with no structural changes, you might get by with design-only services and a good contractor. But here's where that typically breaks down: permitting issues arise with no one to resolve them, contractors make field decisions that compromise the design, or costs escalate because the drawings weren't detailed enough for accurate bidding. We can absolutely tailor our scope - some clients want design only, others want full construction administration. Let me ask: What's your experience level with construction projects? What's your risk tolerance if problems arise? That'll help us right-size the service level."

Here's how we prevent that: Before we design anything, we do rough cost modeling based on your program and quality expectations. If the numbers don't work, we tell you immediately - either we need to adjust scope, quality, or budget. During design, we check costs at multiple milestones, not just at the end. And we have relationships with contractors who give us reality checks throughout the process. I can't guarantee perfect cost prediction - construction markets fluctuate - but I can guarantee we won't design something wildly outside your budget and surprise you later. Would it help to bring a contractor in for early cost validation?"
