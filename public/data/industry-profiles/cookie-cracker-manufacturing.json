SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE DEMANDS FLEXIBILITY\n\nThe days of single-source [INGREDIENT] and rigid formulations are over. Leading manufacturers now:\n- Qualify [NUMBER]+ suppliers for critical ingredients\n- Develop process parameters for [NUMBER]% ingredient variation\n- Implement rapid changeover systems ([NUMBER] minute transitions)\n\nThis isn't just risk management - it's competitive advantage.\n\nThe manufacturers thriving right now aren't necessarily the largest.

Demand was increasing [NUMBER]% year-over-year, but their [SQUARE FOOTAGE] facility was at maximum capacity. Building a new production line would cost $[AMOUNT]M and take [NUMBER] months.\n\nThey needed another solution.\n\nThe Analysis:\n\nWe spent [NUMBER] weeks on their production floor with sensors, stopwatches, and data loggers. What we found:\n\n• Actual oven utilization: [NUMBER]% (not the assumed [NUMBER]%)\n• Changeover time between SKUs: [NUMBER] minutes average\n• Unplanned downtime: [NUMBER] hours per week\n• Sheeting line speed: [NUMBER]% below equipment specification\n\nThe bottleneck wasn't equipment capacity - it was process optimization.\n\nThe Solution:\n\nWe implemented [NUMBER] targeted changes:\n\n1. Optimized baking profiles to increase oven speed by [NUMBER]% while maintaining quality\n2. Reduced changeover time to [NUMBER] minutes through [SPECIFIC METHOD]\n3. Implemented predictive maintenance reducing unplanned stops by [NUMBER]%\n4. Recalibrated sheeting equipment to manufacturer specifications\n5.
