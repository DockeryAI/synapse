Compare that to: the productivity you lose to anxiety, the relationships affected by untreated depression, the physical health costs of chronic stress. One client calculated she was spending $200/month on things to manage her anxiety - supplements, apps, books. Now she spends $120/month on actual therapy and feels better. We verify your insurance before your first visit so there's no surprises.",
