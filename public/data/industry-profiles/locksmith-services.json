MAIN ENTRANCE: Smart lock with individual PIN codes\n   - Codes deactivate automatically on termination date\n   - Entry/exit logs for compliance documentation\n   - Remote unlock for late patients\n\n2. MEDICATION STORAGE: Biometric locks\n   - Fingerprint access for authorized personnel only\n   - Automatic logging for DEA compliance\n   - Cannot be shared or duplicated\n\n3. RECORDS ROOM: Keypad with rotating codes\n   - Code changes monthly\n   - Access limited to compliance officer and physicians\n   - Integration with security camera system\n\n4. EMPLOYEE AREAS: Master key system\n   - Traditional locks for low-security areas\n   - Cost-effective for break rooms, restrooms\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n- Installed over one weekend (no disruption)\n- Staff training sessions (30 min per shift)\n- Documentation for HIPAA audits\n- Ongoing support agreement\n\nRESULTS AFTER 12 MONTHS:\n→ Zero emergency lockout calls\n→ $12,400 saved in locksmith services\n→ 100% compliance on access logging\n→ Staff satisfaction improved (no more lost key panic)\n→ System paid for itself in 8 months\n\nUNEXPECTED BENEFIT:\nDuring a surprise HIPAA audit, the access logs and security documentation received commendation. The auditor noted it as a \"best practice implementation.\"\n\nKEY TAKEAWAY:\nSecurity isn't just about locks - it's about creating systems that protect assets while improving operational efficiency.\n\nFor medical practices, the ROI isn't just financial.

Because they can. Locksmiths can program most keys for $[PRICE]-$[PRICE].\n\n3/ Here's the money-saving trick: Get a spare BEFORE you lose your original.

But 80% of vehicles can be done by a locksmith with the right equipment. Call us first before paying dealer prices.\n\n5/ Pro tip: Take a photo of your key code tag (came with your car).

Here's why that should terrify you (and what to do about it):\n\nMost residential locks are Grade 3 (the lowest security rating). They're designed to keep honest people honest, not determined criminals.\n\nThe average burglar doesn't pick locks - they kick doors. But the ones who DO pick locks? They're in before you'd finish unlocking it yourself.\n\nYour $25 hardware store deadbolt? I can rake it open faster than you can with a key. Not bragging - just physics.\n\nBetter options:\n→ Grade 1 deadbolts ($[PRICE], worth every penny)\n→ Reinforced strike plates (most breaks happen here, not the lock)\n→ Smart locks with alerts (know when someone's at your door)\n→ Security cameras (visible deterrent)\n\nThe goal isn't Fort Knox. It's making your house harder than your neighbor's. Criminals go for easy targets.\n\nYour lock is only as good as your door frame. I've seen $500 locks on doors I could kick through.\n\nReal security is layers:\n1. Visible deterrents (cameras, signs)\n2. Quality locks properly installed\n3. Reinforced entry points\n4. Good lighting\n5. Awareness\n\nSpend $200 on security or $2,000 replacing stolen stuff. Your choice.\n\nQuestions? I'll answer them all.

The door frame was the weak point.\n\n5/ What we did (that same night):\n→ Installed Grade 1 deadbolts front & back\n→ Replaced strike plates with 3\" security plates\n→ Added 3\" screws into wall studs\n→ Installed door reinforcement kit\n→ Added motion-sensor lights\n\nTotal time: 90 minutes\nTotal cost: $[PRICE]\n\n6/ She texted me the next day: \"I actually slept last night.
