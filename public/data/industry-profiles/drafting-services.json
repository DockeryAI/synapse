We can expedite to [SHORTER TIMEFRAME] for rush projects. Where we won't cut corners is the review cycle with you - most plan corrections happen because clients see something in the drawings they want changed.

The software part is learnable, but where most DIYers hit walls is structural requirements, code compliance, and knowing what the local building department expects. If you want to try, I'd suggest calling [JURISDICTION] building department and asking for their residential plan review checklist - that shows everything they'll look for. Also price out structural engineering - most projects need stamped calculations for beams, foundations, etc. If you get stuck or realize it's more than you want to take on, we're here. We've finished many projects people started themselves.",
