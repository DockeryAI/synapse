Dr. [NAME] is hosting a live workshop where you'll learn: why your pain hasn't responded to treatment, the 5 types of chronic pain and which one you have, and treatment options you probably don't know exist. This isn't a sales pitch - it's education. Half the attendees at our last workshop weren't even good candidates for our services, and we told them that. Limited to 30 people because we want time for your specific questions.",

Seasonal Affective Disorder compounds pain perception. Focus messaging on: weather-triggered pain management, indoor exercise alternatives, vitamin D deficiency connection to pain.",
    "spring": "Moderate pain season but gardening injuries spike. Patients attempt activities they haven't done in months, causing acute-on-chronic flare-ups. Allergy season can trigger inflammatory pain increases. Focus messaging on: safe return to outdoor activities, proper body mechanics for yard work, allergy-pain connection.",
    "summer": "Generally lowest pain reporting period due to heat, increased activity, better mood. However, vacation-related injuries increase. Patients may delay treatment. Focus messaging on: don't let pain ruin summer plans, travel pain management, maintaining treatment progress during vacation season.",
    "fall": "Back-to-routine season creates stress-related pain increases. Weather changes begin triggering joint pain. Patients re-commit to health goals. Highest new patient inquiry period. Focus messaging on: fall health reset, preparing for winter pain season, insurance benefits optimization before year-end."
