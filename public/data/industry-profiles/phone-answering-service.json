They've moved past awareness and consideration—they're in decision mode.\n\nYet most businesses treat their phone line as an afterthought:\n→ Relying on overwhelmed staff to answer between tasks\n→ Sending after-hours callers to voicemail purgatory\n→ Using robotic systems that frustrate rather than assist\n\nMeanwhile, the companies that are scaling understand something crucial:\n\nYour phone system is a revenue channel, not an operational expense.\n\nThey invest in professional answering because they know:\n\n1. First impressions happen in seconds\nA professional greeting from a knowledgeable agent builds instant credibility. A harried employee answering between appointments? Not so much.\n\n2. Availability is a competitive advantage\nWhen your competitor's calls go to voicemail at 6 PM and yours are answered by a live person, you win. Every time.\n\n3.
