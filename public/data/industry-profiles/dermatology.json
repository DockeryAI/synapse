        "MYTH #2: Natural = better\n\nPoison ivy is natural. Botulinum toxin saves faces. The source doesn't matter—the science does.",
        "MYTH #3: Pores can 'open and close'\n\nPores don't have muscles. They can appear larger or smaller based on congestion and elasticity, but steam doesn't 'open' them.",
        "MYTH #4: You should feel a 'tingle' for products to work\n\nThat tingle? Often irritation. Effective skincare shouldn't hurt. If it burns, you're damaging your barrier.",
        "MYTH #5: SPF in makeup is enough\n\nYou'd need 7 layers of foundation to get the labeled SPF. Use a dedicated sunscreen. Every. Single. Day.",
        "MYTH #6: Acne means your skin is dirty\n\nAcne is hormonal, genetic, and inflammatory. Over-washing makes it worse. Gentle cleansing + treatment is key.",
        "MYTH #7: You don't need sunscreen on cloudy days\n\nUV rays penetrate clouds. Up to 80% of UV exposure happens on overcast days. Sunscreen isn't optional.",
