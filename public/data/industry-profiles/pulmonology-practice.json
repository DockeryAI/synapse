Even long-standing conditions often respond to specialized treatment approaches that can meaningfully improve your quality of life.",

When medication is needed, we focus on the most effective options with the least burden, and we regularly reassess whether treatments can be adjusted or reduced.",

In our practice, we see three red flags daily: 1) Waking up gasping, 2) Can't climb stairs without stopping, 3) Chronic cough lasting 8+ weeks. The good news? Early detection changes everything. We use spirometry testing that takes 10 minutes and shows exactly what's happening in your lungs. Most insurance covers it 100%.

Watch closely - shake, breathe out fully, press and breathe in slowly for 5 seconds, hold for 10. Most people skip the hold. That's where the medicine deposits in your lungs. If you're using your rescue inhaler more than twice a week, your asthma isn't controlled. You need a controller medication. The difference? Rescue inhalers open airways fast. Controllers prevent inflammation that closes them. Think of it like this: rescue is the ambulance, controller is the seatbelt.",

But here's what's frustrating - most people don't know they have it. Your partner notices the snoring and gasping. You notice the fatigue, brain fog, and morning headaches.
