Focus on non-perishables, paper goods, and items you can freeze. Many members also split cases with neighbors or family. The real win is buying what you do have room for at 20-40% less than retail.",

Here's how successful members handle it: Shop with a list, go after a meal (not hungry!), and start with just the essentials you know you'll use. Track your first three trips to see actual savings. The treasure hunt aspect is fun, but discipline pays off. Would it help to see a sample first-timer shopping list?",

      "objection": "I can find deals at regular grocery stores with coupons and sales",
      "response": "You're right that sales and coupons can offer savings - and savvy shoppers like you should compare. The difference is our everyday prices are typically at or below sale prices elsewhere, without needing to clip coupons or wait for sales. Plus, you save time not hunting deals across multiple stores. Have you calculated the time cost of deal shopping?",

      "objection": "I heard you have to buy the premium membership to really save",
      "response": "Not true - the basic membership delivers the same warehouse prices and access. The executive/premium tier makes sense if you spend about $[XXX] monthly, because the 2% reward pays for the upgrade. Start with basic, track your spending for 3 months, then upgrade if the math works. We can even apply your upgrade retroactively to those purchases.",

      "response": "Distance is a valid consideration. Here's how to think about it: If you're driving [X] miles, plan to shop every 2-3 weeks instead of weekly. The fuel savings at our gas station often offset the drive, and buying in bulk means fewer total trips annually. What if you combined it with other errands in that area?",

We also have self-checkout now at most locations, and our mobile app shows real-time crowd levels. Plus, even with a wait, you're making one trip instead of three weekly grocery runs.",

If you're shopping more than [X] times yearly, your own membership pays for itself plus gives you the freedom to shop on your schedule.",
