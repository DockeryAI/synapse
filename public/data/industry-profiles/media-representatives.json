Behavioral Triggers > Demographic Targeting\n→ \"[DEMOGRAPHIC]\" tells you almost nothing about purchase intent\n→ \"[BEHAVIORAL SIGNAL]\" predicts conversion [X]% better\n→ Real-time optimization beats upfront planning\n\n4. Ecosystem Thinking > Channel Silos\n→ [PLATFORM 1] doesn't compete with [PLATFORM 2]—they complement\n→ Strategic sequencing across platforms lifts results [X]%\n→ Attribution modeling reveals true contribution of each touchpoint\n\n𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗧𝗛𝗜𝗦 𝗠𝗘𝗔𝗡𝗦 𝗙𝗢𝗥 𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗜𝗔 𝗕𝗨𝗬𝗘𝗥𝗦:\n\nStop accepting GRP-based proposals. Demand attention metrics, engagement data, and attribution modeling. The media partners who can't provide this are selling you 1990s solutions to 2024 problems.\n\nYour media rep should be a strategic advisor who understands your business objectives, not an order-taker pushing inventory.\n\nThe brands winning in [INDUSTRY] right now?
