SPECIFIC SERVICE FREQUENCY\nNot \"monthly visits\"—but detailed schedules:\n→ Interior inspections: [FREQUENCY]\n→ Exterior perimeter treatments: [FREQUENCY]\n→ Monitoring station checks: [FREQUENCY]\n→ Tenant unit treatments: [PROTOCOL]\n\n2.

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) APPROACH\n→ Sanitation recommendations\n→ Exclusion and structural repairs\n→ Habitat modification strategies\n→ Least-toxic treatment options\n\n5.

Here's the #1 mistake homeowners make (thread)\n\n1/ The mistake: Spraying the ants you see with store-bought killer.\n\nWhy it backfires: You're only killing 5% of the colony. The other 95% are hidden in walls.\n\n2/ Worse: Many sprays cause \"budding\"—the colony splits into multiple colonies to survive. You just made 1 problem into 3 problems.\n\n3/ What works instead:\n→ Don't disturb the trails\n→ Use bait that workers carry back to the colony\n→ Target the queen, not the workers\n→ Be patient (takes 7-14 days)\n\n4/ Professional tip: Different ant species need different baits. [ANT_TYPE] prefer [BAIT_TYPE]. [OTHER_ANT_TYPE] need [OTHER_BAIT_TYPE].\n\nMisidentify the species = wrong bait = wasted time.\n\n5/ Prevention beats treatment:\n→ Seal entry points (ants fit through gaps the width of a credit card)\n→ Fix moisture issues (most ants need water)\n→ Store food in airtight containers\n→ Clean up spills immediately\n\n6/ When to call a pro:\n→ Infestation lasts >2 weeks\n→ You see [NUMBER]+ ants daily\n→ Multiple colonies/species\n→ Ants in unusual places (bathrooms, bedrooms)\n→ Structural damage visible\n\n7/ Bottom line: Effective ant control is about biology, not chemicals.
