Adults actually have advantages - you can afford better instruction, you practice more thoughtfully, and you're doing it for pure joy, not pressure.

But here's what we see: kids quit when the instrument is frustrating to play or when parents don't support the practice. If you get a decent instrument and help them through the first tough months, most stick with it. And even if they don't, they'll have learned discipline, creativity, and had an experience many kids never get. Is that a waste?",
