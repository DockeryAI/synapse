They had 847 SOPs. Beautifully formatted. Comprehensive. Stored in a SharePoint everyone could access.\n\nTheir teams followed maybe 12% of them.\n\nThe problem isn't lack of documentation. It's documentation designed for compliance, not execution.\n\nHere's what actually works:\n\n1. ROLE-BASED, NOT PROCESS-BASED\nStop writing \"Order to Cash Process - 47 pages.\"\nStart writing \"What CSRs do when orders arrive - 1 page.\"\nPeople need their part, not the whole symphony score.\n\n2. DECISION TREES, NOT PARAGRAPHS\n\"If X, then Y\" beats narrative every time.\nYour team makes 20+ micro-decisions per process.\nDocument the decision points, not the philosophy.\n\n3. EMBEDDED WHERE WORK HAPPENS\nIf your process doc lives in a different system than where work occurs, it's already obsolete.\nPut guidance inside the ERP, CRM, or workflow tool.\n\n4. EXCEPTION-FOCUSED\nYour team knows the happy path.\nThey need help when [CUSTOMER] does [UNEXPECTED THING].\nDocument the 80% of scenarios that happen 20% of the time.\n\n5. MAINTAINED BY PRACTITIONERS\nProcess owners should review quarterly.\nActual doers should update weekly.\nIf the people doing the work can't edit the doc, it'll drift from reality.\n\nThe manufacturer? We converted their 847 SOPs into 63 role-based job aids embedded in their systems.\n\nAdoption went from 12% to 94% in 6 months.\nTraining time for new hires: down 60%.\n\nYour documentation should make work easier, not create a parallel universe of \"how we say we work.\"\n\nWhat's your documentation-to-adoption ratio?

Agile works.\n\nIt's the implementation sequence.\n\nMost companies follow this path:\n1. Identify broken process\n2. Assemble improvement team\n3. Map current state\n4. Design future state\n5. Implement changes\n6. Train people\n7. Monitor adoption\n\nSeems logical, right?\n\nExcept step 6 is where [X]% of initiatives die.\n\nBecause by the time you reach training, you've:\n- Spent 4 months designing\n- Built political capital around YOUR solution\n- Created change fatigue\n- Lost the \"why\" in the details\n\nThe people doing the work? They see a solution imposed on them.\n\nHere's what actually works—the Inverted Implementation Model:\n\n1. IDENTIFY THE PAIN (with the team, not for them)\n→ Facilitated sessions where practitioners describe friction\n→ Quantify impact in their language (\"3 hours/week on rework\")\n\n2. CO-CREATE EXPERIMENTS (not solutions)\n→ \"What if we tried [X] for 2 weeks?\"\n→ Small, reversible changes\n→ Team designs, you guide\n\n3. RUN RAPID PILOTS (fail fast, learn faster)\n→ 2-week sprints\n→ Measure 2-3 metrics max\n→ Kill what doesn't work, scale what does\n\n4. DOCUMENT WHAT WORKED (not what you planned)\n→ Capture the actual process that emerged\n→ Let practitioners write it\n\n5. SCALE WITH CHAMPIONS (not mandates)\n→ Pilot team becomes trainers\n→ Peer-to-peer adoption\n→ Leadership reinforces, doesn't enforce\n\nLast year, we used this with a healthcare system redesigning patient intake.\n\nTraditional approach (first 3 clinics): 6 months, 40% adoption, reverted within a year.\n\nInverted approach (next 12 clinics): 8 weeks, 89% adoption, still running 18 months later.\n\nThe difference? Ownership.\n\nWhen people design their own improvements, they don't need to be \"change managed.\"\n\nThey're already bought in.\n\nYour role as a process consultant isn't to have the best answer.\n\nIt's to create the conditions where the best answer emerges from the people closest to the work.\n\nThen get out of the way.\n\n---\n\nWhat's your experience with process improvement adoption?

Three checks within it. Clear accountability.\n\nCompliance incidents? Actually decreased by 18%. Because people were paying attention to one thorough review instead of rushing through three redundant ones.\n\nThe lesson:\n\nBefore you buy new software, audit your process.\n\nMost \"technology problems\" are actually process design problems wearing a technology disguise.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the longest process in your organization?
