      "underlying_concern": "Confusion about role and value of OT versus PT",
      "authentic_response": "That's a great question - they sound similar but focus on different goals. PT helps you move better - like walking or strength. OT helps you do better - like getting dressed, cooking, or getting back to work. Many people benefit from both. What specific activities are you struggling with right now?",

      "underlying_concern": "Already overwhelmed with medical appointments and life demands",
      "authentic_response": "I hear you - when you're already struggling, adding more to your schedule feels impossible. Here's what's different: OT is about making your daily life easier, not adding to it. We work on the actual tasks you need to do anyway, and give you strategies to save time and energy. Many clients find they actually get time back. What's taking the most time in your day right now?",

      "objection": "What if it doesn't work?",
      "underlying_concern": "Fear of investing time and money without guaranteed results",
      "authentic_response": "That's a fair concern - you've probably tried things that didn't help before. Here's how we approach it: we'll set specific, measurable goals together in the first session. After [3-4] visits, we'll review your progress. If you're not seeing meaningful improvement in the things that matter to you, we'll adjust our approach or discuss other options. You're in control of continuing. What would success look like for you?",
      "proof_element": "Offer progress checkpoints and collaborative goal-setting"

    {
      "objection": "My doctor didn't mention occupational therapy",
      "underlying_concern": "Uncertainty about whether this is medically necessary or appropriate",
      "authentic_response": "Doctors are managing so many aspects of your care, and sometimes OT isn't on their radar for your specific situation. The good news is we can reach out to your doctor to discuss whether OT would be beneficial and get a referral if appropriate. Many physicians welcome our input. Would you like us to contact your doctor's office to discuss your situation?",

      "authentic_response": "I understand why you might feel that way - we're often told things are 'just part of aging.' But here's what we see every day: people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s making real improvements in their independence. It's not about turning back the clock - it's about finding smarter ways to do what matters to you. Age affects how we approach therapy, but it doesn't determine whether you can improve. What would you like to be able to do that you're not doing now?",
      "proof_element": "Share age-appropriate success stories and realistic expectations"

    {
      "objection": "I can just watch YouTube videos and figure it out myself",
      "underlying_concern": "Desire to avoid cost and maintain control over recovery",
      "authentic_response": "You're resourceful - and there is good information online. Here's the difference: generic videos don't know your specific limitations, your home setup, or your goals. We assess exactly what's holding you back and create a personalized plan. We also catch compensatory patterns that can lead to pain or injury down the road. Think of it like this: you could watch videos about fixing your car, but a mechanic sees things you don't. Would you be open to an evaluation to see what specific issues we identify?",
      "proof_element": "Offer evaluation to demonstrate personalized value"
    },
    {
      "objection": "I'm worried my child will be labeled or stigmatized",
      "underlying_concern": "Fear that therapy means something is 'wrong' with their child",
      "authentic_response": "That's a very real concern - you want to protect your child. Here's how I see it: getting help isn't a label, it's a tool. Just like glasses help kids see better, OT gives kids strategies to succeed. The kids who struggle without support are more likely to feel different. When we give them the tools they need, they feel capable and confident. Our goal is to help your child participate fully. What concerns you most about others' perceptions?",
      "proof_element": "Reframe therapy as empowerment and share positive child outcomes"
    },

      "objection": "I've tried therapy before and it didn't help",
      "underlying_concern": "Disappointment from past failed interventions creating skepticism",
      "authentic_response": "I'm sorry you had that experience - it's discouraging when you invest time and don't see results. Can you tell me more about what you tried before? Sometimes the timing wasn't right, the approach wasn't a good fit, or the goals weren't aligned with what mattered most to you. We'd start by understanding what didn't work before and why, so we don't repeat that. Would you be willing to share what you tried so we can approach this differently?",
      "proof_element": "Learn from past experience and differentiate current approach"
    },
    {
      "objection": "I need to focus on getting stronger first, then I'll do OT",
      "underlying_concern": "Belief that physical recovery must precede functional recovery",
      "authentic_response": "That makes sense - you want to be strong enough to benefit. Here's what research shows: working on real activities actually builds strength faster than waiting. When we practice getting dressed or cooking, you're building exactly the strength and coordination you need for those tasks. Plus, we can start where you are now and progress together. Waiting often means losing more ground. What if we could work on strength and function at the same time?",
