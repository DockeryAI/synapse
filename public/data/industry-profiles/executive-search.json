Identifying them, building trust, conducting proper assessment, and facilitating their exit from current role responsibly takes time.

The executives you need to attract are not scanning job postings or responding to InMails. They have trusted relationships with search partners built over years, and they take calls from us because we've proven we only bring them truly compelling opportunities. Additionally, for confidential searches or situations involving current executive transitions, you need a third-party buffer.

Additionally, approaching candidates directly creates dynamics around negotiation and assessment that can be challenging. What I'd suggest is we look at your candidates together—if they're truly the best available, we should be pursuing them.

You'll have my cell number and we'll have scheduled check-ins every [X days] minimum. More importantly, my reputation in [INDUSTRY/FUNCTION] depends on successful placements—I only get repeat business and referrals when clients like you are thrilled with the outcome.

But here's what's more important than the guarantee terms: our process is specifically designed to minimize that risk. We're conducting [SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT APPROACHES], we're doing extensive reference work beyond the names they provide, and we're pressure-testing cultural fit and motivation factors. Our replacement rate is [X%] because we're rigorous on the front end.
