Next, check for knots—small ones are fine, but avoid boards where knots are falling out. Finally, feel the moisture—if it's damp or heavy, it hasn't dried properly and will warp after you install it. Grab the straightest, driest boards from the middle of the stack.",

If you drain it completely and leave it for months, it degrades. Here's what to do: Store batteries at room temperature, around 50% charge. If you're not using them for a while, charge them to half and bring them inside. This simple change can double your battery life.",
