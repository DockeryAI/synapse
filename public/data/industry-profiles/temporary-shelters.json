[SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OR PROTOCOL]\n\n2. HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS\nFrom medication management to communicable disease prevention, shelters must function as semi-medical environments with proper screening, isolation capabilities, and health monitoring systems.\n\n3.

Laundry facilities, showers, secure storage for belongings. But here's what makes us different: every resident gets a personalized stability plan within 48 hours. We're not just a roof - we're a bridge to permanent housing.",
