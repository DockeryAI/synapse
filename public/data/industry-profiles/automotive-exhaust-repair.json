Visible rust holes or hanging components\n\n𝗖𝗢𝗦𝗧-𝗦𝗔𝗩𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗧𝗜𝗣:\n\nMany exhaust issues are symptomatic of upstream problems. A failing catalytic converter, for instance, is often caused by:\n- Faulty oxygen sensors\n- Engine misfires\n- Oil consumption issues\n\nReplacing the cat without addressing the root cause means you'll be replacing it again in 12-18 months.\n\nAt [SHOP_NAME], we've built our reputation on comprehensive diagnostics.

You're back in 12-18 months with the same problem.\n\n2/ Example: Customer comes in with a rusted-out muffler.\n\nTypical shop: Weld on a new muffler. $200. Done.\n\nWhat they missed: Excessive condensation from short trips + failing thermostat causing the rust.\n\nOur approach: Fix the root cause OR educate the customer on prevention.\n\n3/ Another example: Failed catalytic converter.\n\nTypical shop: Replace cat. $1,500.
