We help you navigate which funding sources apply to your situation. Our job is to remove barriers to employment, and cost shouldn't be one of them. Let's explore your funding options together.",

Some people disclose to get accommodations, others don't need to. We teach you how to talk about your capabilities first, and if you choose to disclose, how to do it strategically and confidently.
