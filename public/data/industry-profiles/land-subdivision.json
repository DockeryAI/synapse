That said, we build in flexibility - you can sell some lots yourself, use a realtor for others, or we can connect you with investors who buy multiple lots. You also keep the lots as long-term investment if market softens - they're not perishable. What's your timeline expectation for getting your capital back?",

Here's what separates profitable subdivisions from expensive learning experiences:\n\n1. COMPREHENSIVE FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS FIRST\nDon't fall in love with a lot layout before confirming: zoning allows it, utilities can reach it, soil can support it, and market demands it. We analyze [NUMBER] factors before drawing a single property line.\n\n2. UNDERSTAND TRUE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS\nRoads, water, sewer, drainage, electricity—budget [PERCENTAGE]% above initial estimates. The difference between preliminary numbers and final costs has killed more projects than bad locations.\n\n3. ENVIRONMENTAL DUE DILIGENCE ISN'T OPTIONAL\nWetlands, endangered species, archaeological sites, contamination—any of these can halt your project. Phase I and II environmental assessments protect your investment.\n\n4. STRATEGIC LOT CONFIGURATION MAXIMIZES VALUE\nLot size, orientation, views, privacy, and utility access all impact sellability. Cookie-cutter divisions leave money on the table. We've increased project values by [PERCENTAGE]% through thoughtful lot design alone.\n\n5. NAVIGATE APPROVALS WITH EXPERIENCED PARTNERS\nPlanning commissions, utility districts, DOT requirements, impact fees—the regulatory maze is complex and locally specific.

Three out of four means you're gambling, not developing.\n\nWHY WE SAY NO:\n\nSome properties face utility extension costs exceeding $[AMOUNT] per lot—economically unfeasible in most markets. Others have perfect infrastructure but sit in oversupplied submarkets where lot inventory already exceeds [NUMBER] months. Some require environmental mitigation that consumes [PERCENTAGE]% of created value.\n\nSaying no protects our clients from expensive mistakes and preserves our track record for projects we do accept.\n\nWHEN WE SAY YES:\n\nOur accepted projects average [PERCENTAGE]% ROI because we're selective.
