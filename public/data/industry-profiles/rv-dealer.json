Look for soft spots and staining.\n\n2️⃣ TIRES: RV tires expire after 6-7 years regardless of tread. Check the DOT date code on the sidewall.\n\n3️⃣ WEIGHT CAPACITY: Your [RV CLASS] has a GVWR of [WEIGHT]. Overloading voids warranties and creates safety issues.\n\n4️⃣ WINTERIZATION: If buying used, ask if it was properly winterized. Frozen pipes = $2K+ in repairs.\n\n5️⃣ TEST EVERYTHING: Run the generator, AC, furnace, fridge, and water pump during your walkthrough.\n\n💡 Pro tip: Bring a checklist to your viewing appointment.

        "body": "The RV industry just hit $65 billion in annual revenue, but 40% of first-time buyers make these 3 costly mistakes.\n\nAfter [NUMBER] years in RV sales and helping [NUMBER]+ families find their perfect rig, I've identified the patterns that separate successful RV ownership from buyer's remorse.\n\nMISTAKE #1: Buying for the Fantasy, Not the Reality\n\nThe average RV owner uses their vehicle [NUMBER] days per year. Yet many buyers choose based on a retirement dream that's 10 years away. Result? A depreciating asset sitting unused.\n\nBetter approach: Match your purchase to your current lifestyle. You can always upgrade when circumstances change.\n\nMISTAKE #2: Ignoring Total Cost of Ownership\n\nThe sticker price is just the beginning:\n→ Insurance: $[RANGE] annually\n→ Storage: $[RANGE] per month\n→ Maintenance: $[RANGE] per year\n→ Fuel: [MPG RANGE] typical consumption\n→ Campground fees: $[RANGE] per night\n\nA $[PRICE] RV actually costs $[TOTAL] over 5 years of ownership.\n\nMISTAKE #3: Mismatching Tow Vehicle and RV\n\nI've seen countless buyers fall in love with an RV their vehicle can't safely tow. This creates three bad options:\n1. Expensive tow vehicle upgrade\n2. Unsafe towing situation\n3. Return the RV (often at a loss)\n\nAlways verify: GVWR, tongue weight, and your vehicle's actual towing capacity (not the marketing number).\n\nTHE SOLUTION:\n\nWork with a dealer who asks about your lifestyle before showing you inventory. The best RV sale is one where the customer is still happy 5 years later.\n\nWhat questions should first-time RV buyers ask that most don't? I'd love to hear perspectives from other industry professionals.\n\n#RVIndustry #RVSales #CustomerEducation #RVDealer #RecreationalVehicles #OutdoorRecreation",

        "body": "The RV market is shifting, and dealers who don't adapt will be left behind. Here's what I'm seeing from the frontlines.\n\nThe pandemic created an unprecedented RV boom. Shipments hit 600,000+ units in 2021. But 2024 tells a different story.\n\nTHREE MAJOR SHIFTS I'M OBSERVING:\n\n1. THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY WINS\n\nToday's buyers don't just want an RV. They want confidence they're making the right choice. At [DEALERSHIP NAME], we've invested heavily in:\n\n→ Comprehensive walkthroughs (90+ minutes average)\n→ Lifestyle consultation before product selection  \n→ Post-purchase education programs\n→ Active owner community building\n\nResult: [PERCENTAGE]% customer retention and [NUMBER] referrals this year alone.\n\n2. USED MARKET SOPHISTICATION\n\nBuyers are more educated than ever. They know:\n→ Depreciation curves by manufacturer\n→ Common failure points by model year\n→ Fair market values within $500\n\nThe days of information asymmetry are over. Transparency isn't optional—it's table stakes.\n\n3. FINANCING DETERMINES INVENTORY\n\nWith interest rates at [RATE]%, payment sensitivity is extreme. We've shifted our inventory mix toward:\n\n→ [PERCENTAGE]% units under $[PRICE POINT]\n→ More [CLASS B/TOWABLE] options\n→ Certified pre-owned programs with warranty coverage\n\nThe $150K+ luxury segment? Moving slower than ever.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\n\nDealerships that treat RV sales as transactional will struggle. Those who build relationships, educate buyers, and create community will thrive.\n\nWe're not in the RV sales business. We're in the outdoor lifestyle enablement business.\n\nWhat trends are you seeing in recreational vehicle retail?

We're retiring and going full-time.\"\n\nBudget: $[AMOUNT]\nTimeline: Immediate\nExperience level: Zero RV trips\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n\nMost dealers would have made that sale immediately.
