          "body": "Ground Penetrating Radar isn't magic—it's physics. Here's how GPR actually \"sees\" underground in 60 seconds 🧵\n\n1/ GPR sends electromagnetic pulses into the ground (10 MHz to 2.6 GHz depending on target depth)\n\n2/ When pulses hit objects with different electrical properties (utilities, voids, soil layers), some energy reflects back\n\n3/ The antenna receives these reflections. Time = depth. Amplitude = material contrast.\n\n4/ Software processes thousands of traces into a profile showing subsurface features\n\n5/ Key factors affecting performance:\n• Soil type (clay blocks signals)\n• Moisture content (reduces depth)\n• Target size vs. depth\n• Frequency selection\n\n6/ Common applications:\n→ Utility location before excavation\n→ Void detection under pavements\n→ Concrete/rebar assessment\n→ Archaeological investigations\n→ [APPLICATION]\n\n7/ Pro tip: GPR shows anomalies, not labels. Interpretation requires understanding site context + physics.\n\n8/ Depth range: 0-15m typically, but highly site-dependent. Clay = shallow. Dry sand = deep.\n\n9/ Why it matters: Non-invasive, real-time data, continuous coverage. See what's below BEFORE you dig.\n\n10/ Bottom line: GPR is one tool in the geophysical toolkit. Match method to objective for best results.\n\nQuestions about GPR or other geophysical methods? Drop them below. 👇",
