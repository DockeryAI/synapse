        "Myth 1: \"Any security guard can transport cash safely\"\n\nReality: Specialized training in threat assessment, route planning, and emergency protocols is critical. 73% of cash losses involve untrained personnel.",
        "Myth 2: \"Armored cars are just for banks\"\n\nReality: Retail stores, ATM operators, cannabis dispensaries, and casinos all need secure transport. If you handle $10K+ weekly, you need professional service.",
        "Myth 3: \"Insurance covers everything\"\n\nReality: Most policies have strict requirements. Using non-certified transport can void your coverage entirely. Always check your policy's transport clause.",
        "Myth 4: \"More guards = more security\"\n\nReality: Route intelligence, vehicle tech, and communication systems matter more. We've seen 2-person teams outperform 5-person amateur operations.",
        "Myth 5: \"It's too expensive for small businesses\"\n\nReality: The average cash theft costs $47K. Our service starts at $200/pickup. One prevented incident pays for 5+ years of service.",
        "Bottom line: Professional armored transport isn't an expense—it's insurance you can see working.\n\nDM us for a free security assessment of your current cash handling process."
