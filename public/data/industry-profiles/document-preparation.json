The AI-generated operating agreement looked perfect - professional formatting, legal language, all the right sections.\n\nIt was also completely wrong for their situation.\n\nThe template assumed:\n- Equal ownership (they had 60/40)\n- No special voting rights (they needed approval thresholds)\n- Standard profit distribution (they wanted reinvestment requirements)\n- Generic dissolution terms (they had specific buyout agreements)\n\nFixing it cost more than doing it right initially.\n\nHere's what I've learned after preparing 12,000+ documents across 15 years:\n\nAI EXCELS AT:\n→ Standard form completion\n→ Consistency in formatting\n→ Basic compliance checking\n→ Speed for simple documents\n\nHUMAN EXPERTISE MATTERS FOR:\n→ Jurisdiction-specific nuances (California vs. Delaware LLCs are vastly different)\n→ Understanding context (why you need the document affects how it's prepared)\n→ Anticipating downstream issues (how this document affects your taxes, liability, future transactions)\n→ Navigating exceptions (when standard doesn't apply)\n\nReal example: Apostille requirements vary by country and document type. I work with 47 different countries regularly. An AI might tell you that you need an apostille. I can tell you that the Embassy of [specific country] requires additional authentication beyond the apostille, and which specific office in your state handles it, and that they're only open Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nThe future isn't human vs. AI.

During due diligence, investors discovered their 2018 stock option grants had never been properly documented. The original paralegal had used incorrect forms. 47 employees had potentially invalid options.\n\nDeal-breaker territory.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n→ Original grants were verbal agreements (common in early startups, not legally sufficient)\n→ Strike prices needed to be reconstructed from 409A valuations\n→ Some employees had left; signatures needed from 12 states\n→ Board resolutions were missing for 23 grants\n→ Investors wanted everything corrected before funding\n\nTHE TIMELINE:\nFriday afternoon discovery. Tuesday closing. We had the weekend.\n\nOUR APPROACH:\nSaturday: Reconstructed grant history from email records, payroll data, and cap table\nSunday: Drafted corrective resolutions, option agreements, and amendment documents\nMonday: Coordinated overnight shipping to 12 states, arranged for remote notarization where accepted, sent mobile notaries where required\nTuesday morning: Final documents to investors' counsel\n\nTHE DETAILS THAT MATTERED:\n- Used Section 409A safe harbor provisions to validate original strike prices\n- Drafted board resolutions that ratified grants retroactively (legally permissible in Delaware)\n- Structured as amendments rather than new grants to preserve original vesting schedules\n- Coordinated with company counsel to ensure investor agreement compliance\n\nTHE RESULT:\nAll 47 option grants properly documented. Deal closed on schedule. $3M funding secured.\n\nFounder's quote: \"You saved our company. Our lawyer said it couldn't be done in time.\"\n\nLESSONS FOR FOUNDERS:\n1. Document equity grants immediately, not eventually\n2. Use proper forms, not email confirmations\n3. Keep a document audit trail from day one\n4. When you discover problems, speed matters as much as accuracy\n\nThe difference between a closed deal and a blown opportunity often comes down to documentation discipline.\n\nHave you encountered document issues during fundraising or M&A?
