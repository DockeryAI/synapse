FERMENTATION TEMPERATURE CONTROL\nMost craft distilleries let fermentation \"run hot\" (85-95°F) to speed up the process. But the best flavor compounds develop between [TEMP RANGE]°F. We installed [COOLING SYSTEM] and saw [METRIC IMPROVEMENT] in our sensory scores.\n\n2. CUTS PRECISION\nThe difference between good and exceptional spirits is often just 2-3% of your run. We analyze [METRIC] in real-time and make cuts based on [SPECIFIC CRITERIA], not arbitrary percentages.\n\n3. BARREL ENTRY PROOF\nEntering barrels at [PROOF] instead of [PROOF] changes everything about maturation. Lower entry proof means [BENEFIT], but [TRADEOFF].\n\n4. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING\nWe track [X] data points in our rickhouse daily. Last year, this data helped us prevent [SPECIFIC ISSUE] that would have cost [DOLLAR AMOUNT].\n\nThe craft spirits movement was built on quality, not shortcuts. As the industry matures, the distilleries that win will be those who understand the science behind the craft.\n\nWhat quality control measures have made the biggest difference in your operation?",
