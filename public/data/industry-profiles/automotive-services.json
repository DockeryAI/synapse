PRICE-MATCH GUARANTEE WITH CONTEXT\nWe'll match any written estimate, but we also explain:\n• Part quality differences (OEM vs. aftermarket vs. economy)\n• Warranty variations ([WARRANTY_1] vs. [WARRANTY_2])\n• What's included in labor (diagnostics, testing, cleanup)\nResult: [PERCENTAGE]% choose our recommendation after understanding value\n\n5.
