What am I missing?\"\n\nThis conversation matters more than most people realize.\n\n3/ Our [SUBSPECIALTY] radiologist reviewed outside images + clinical notes. Recommendation: Repeat [IMAGING_TYPE] with [SPECIFIC_PROTOCOL] modification.\n\n4/ Key protocol changes:\n→ [TECHNICAL_MODIFICATION_1]  \n→ [TECHNICAL_MODIFICATION_2]\n→ [ADVANCED_SEQUENCE] added\n→ [SPECIFIC_POSITIONING]\n\n5/ New findings: [PATHOLOGY] clearly visible with modified protocol. Explained entire symptom complex. Previous imaging used standard protocol—appropriate for most cases, but not this one.\n\n6/ Clinical impact:\n→ Diagnosis: [SPECIFIC_DIAGNOSIS]\n→ Treatment: [INTERVENTION]\n→ Outcome: [RESULT] at [TIMEFRAME] follow-up\n\n7/ What made the difference?\n\na) Physician-radiologist communication\nb) Subspecialty expertise  \nc) Protocol customization\nd) Willingness to question \"normal\" findings when clinically discordant\n\n8/ Lesson for patients: If your symptoms don't match your imaging results, it's okay to ask:\n\"Could different imaging show something else?\"\n\"Should I get a second opinion read?\"\n\"Is there a subspecialist who could review this?\"\n\n9/ Lesson for clinicians: That phone call to radiology? It's not bothering us. It's collaborative medicine. It's how we catch the zebras.\n\n10/ The best diagnostic imaging isn't just about equipment—it's about:\n✓ Expertise\n✓ Communication  \n✓ Customization\n✓ Persistence\n\nQuality imaging = Technology + Teamwork\n\n*Details modified for patient privacy",
