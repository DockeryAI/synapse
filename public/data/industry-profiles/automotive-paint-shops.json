We've stripped dozens of budget paint jobs this year alone. Our process: full disassembly, rust treatment, proper primer systems, 3-stage paint, and wet sanding between coats.

Then we clear coat those panels too so the shine matches. Watch as we scan this faded red Honda - the computer shows it's actually 3 shades lighter than factory. We mix a custom batch, spray a test panel, and adjust until it's invisible. This is why panel blending costs more - but it's the only way to make repairs disappear.",
