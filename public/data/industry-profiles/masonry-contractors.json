        "body": "🧱 THREAD: 5 things every homeowner should know about brick maintenance (that most contractors won't tell you)\n\n1/ Brick doesn't fail. Mortar does.\n\nYour brick will outlast you. It's the mortar joints that need attention every 25-30 years. Ignore them and water gets in—then you've got real problems.\n\n2/ Not all tuckpointing is equal.\n\nMortar must be SOFTER than the brick. Too many contractors use hard Portland cement mix that damages brick. Proper lime-based mortar is crucial for pre-1930s buildings.\n\n3/ Power washing brick = bad idea.\n\nHigh pressure damages mortar joints and the brick face. We use low-pressure chemical cleaning. Your brick's protective fire skin matters.\n\n4/ \"Waterproof\" sealers trap moisture.\n\nBrick needs to breathe. Use breathable water repellents, not sealers. Trapped moisture causes spalling (brick face popping off). We see this constantly.\n\n5/ White staining (efflorescence) is a WARNING.\n\nThose white deposits mean water is moving through your masonry. Don't just clean it—find and fix the source. Usually failed mortar, missing flashing, or drainage issues.\n\nBONUS: Cracks wider than [MEASUREMENT] need professional assessment.
