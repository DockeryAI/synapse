HVAC System Downgrades\nSaving $[AMOUNT] per unit upfront leads to $[AMOUNT] in service calls during the first year and unhappy residents who leave negative reviews.\n\n2. Cheaper Flooring Materials\nLVP that costs $[AMOUNT] less per square foot needs replacement after 2 tenant turnovers instead of 5. You're not saving money - you're deferring costs to the operator.\n\n3. Simplified Waterproofing\nWe've been called in to remediate [NUMBER] buildings where developers skipped proper deck waterproofing. The fix cost 10x the original savings.\n\nThe smart approach? Strategic value engineering:\n→ Invest in building envelope and mechanicals (they're expensive to fix later)\n→ Consider prefab/modular for repetitive elements (real savings without quality loss)\n→ Simplify finishes thoughtfully (residents don't need granite, but they do need durability)\n\nAt [COMPANY_NAME], we present clients with a \"Total Cost of Ownership\" analysis, not just construction costs.

PREFABRICATION & MODULAR CONSTRUCTION\nWe've shifted [PERCENTAGE]% of our repetitive elements (bathroom pods, mechanical chases, exterior panels) to controlled factory environments.

Procurement Pivot (Month 2)\nWe ordered elevators, windows, and major mechanicals [NUMBER] months earlier than normal scheduling, even before foundation completion. Cost: $[AMOUNT] in early payment. Savings: kept project on schedule.\n\n2. Design Adaptability (Month 4)\nWhen specified appliance packages became unavailable, we worked with the architect to pre-approve [NUMBER] alternative manufacturers.

When we identified risks [NUMBER] weeks out, we had time to solve them.\n\n4.
