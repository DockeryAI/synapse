Profile photo quality - Professional doesn't mean corporate headshot. It means clear, recent, and approachable. No sunglasses, no group photos, no exceptions.\n\n3. About section hook - If your first sentence doesn't communicate value, we're moving on. Start with your biggest professional achievement or the specific problem you solve.\n\n4. Experience bullets - Paragraphs lose. Bullet points with quantified results win. We're looking for [X]% increases, $[Y] revenue generated, [Z] team members led.\n\n5. Skills section accuracy - Endorsements matter less than you think. Order matters more. Your top 3 skills should match the roles you're targeting.\n\n6. Activity and engagement - Profiles that share insights, comment thoughtfully, and post occasionally signal active professionals. Ghost profiles signal passive candidates.\n\nWhat recruiters ignore:\n→ Recommendations (we'll ask for references)\n→ Courses and certifications beyond top 3\n→ Volunteer experience (unless relevant to role)\n→ Interests section\n\nThe profile optimization framework that works:\n\n[WEEK 1] Audit current profile against target role descriptions\n[WEEK 2] Rewrite headline and about section with keywords\n[WEEK 3] Quantify all experience bullets with metrics\n[WEEK 4] Engage with industry content 3x per week\n\nProfiles optimized this way see [X]% more recruiter outreach within 30 days.\n\nWhat's the #1 element you're updating first?",

Reverse engineer your target company list\nDon't search job boards. Identify 20 companies where you'd thrive.

Find them through LinkedIn, industry events, and mutual connections. Your goal: be known before the req opens.\n\n3. Create referral pathways\n[X]% of hires come through referrals. But most people ask wrong: \"Know of any jobs?\" Instead: \"I'm exploring [SPECIFIC ROLE] at [COMPANY]. Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about the team culture?\"\n\n4. Build visible expertise\nShare insights in your field. Comment on industry trends. Publish your perspective. When your name appears in searches, you're already pre-qualified.\n\n5. Work with specialized recruiters\nGeneral job boards cast wide nets. Specialized recruiters in [INDUSTRY] have exclusive roles and direct client relationships.
