But after two decades in industrial design, I've noticed something troubling:\n\nThe industry celebrates form over feasibility.\n\nWe see renderings that would require six-figure tooling for a startup's first 1,000 units. We see material choices that look stunning but can't survive real-world use. We see assemblies that need hand-fitting because the tolerances don't stack.\n\nAnd we wonder why 95% of product ideas never make it to market.\n\nThe designers I most respect aren't the ones winning awards for concepts that will never be produced. They're the ones who understand:\n\n✓ How to design a living hinge that survives 10,000 cycles\n✓ Why a 2-degree draft angle matters more than perfect surfacing\n✓ When to add $0.03 to unit cost to eliminate a $50,000 assembly fixture\n✓ How material selection impacts everything from tooling to shipping costs\n\nReal industrial design is the elegant synthesis of aesthetics, engineering, economics, and manufacturing reality.\n\nIt's designing the screw boss that makes assembly foolproof. It's choosing the parting line that minimizes tool complexity. It's understanding that sometimes the best design decision is the one that saves your client from bankruptcy.\n\nThe most beautiful product is the one that actually exists in customers' hands.\n\nAnd it got there because a designer understood that constraints aren't creativity killers—they're the foundation of innovative problem-solving.\n\nWhat's your take?
