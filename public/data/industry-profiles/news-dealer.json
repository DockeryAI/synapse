LOCAL JOURNALISM IS CRITICAL\nNational news matters, but local reporting drives community engagement. We've seen a [PERCENTAGE]% increase in local publication sales as people recognize the value of regional journalism.\n\n3. PRINT STILL DELIVERS DEPTH\nDigital is immediate. Print is immersive. The tactile experience of reading a physical newspaper or magazine creates different cognitive engagement—our customers report better retention and comprehension.\n\n4. SPECIALIZATION WINS\nGeneral interest publications are struggling, but niche titles are thriving. Whether it's [INDUSTRY_1], [INDUSTRY_2], or [HOBBY], specialized journalism finds dedicated audiences.\n\n5. TRUST IS EVERYTHING\nIn an era of misinformation, readers are willing to pay for verified, fact-checked journalism. Subscription rates at quality publications are rising.\n\nThe future of news isn't either/or—it's both/and. Digital for speed, print for depth.
