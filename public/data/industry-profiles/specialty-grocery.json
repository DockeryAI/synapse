When a customer asks about [SPECIALTY_INGREDIENT], we don't point to an aisle - we share how it's made, why [PRODUCER_NAME] does it differently, and three ways to use it this week.\n\n3. CURATED DISCOVERY OVER ENDLESS SELECTION\n\nWe stock [NUMBER] SKUs, not [LARGER_NUMBER]. Each product earns its place through [CRITERIA]. This curation creates trust. Customers know that if it's on our shelves, we've personally vetted [QUALITY_ASPECT].\n\n4. COMMUNITY AS INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOur [EVENT_TYPE] events, [PROGRAM_NAME] classes, and partnerships with [LOCAL_ENTITY] have created a ecosystem where [OUTCOME].
