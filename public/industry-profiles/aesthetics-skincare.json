        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nYou're doing everything right: SPF daily, quality serums, consistent routine.\n\nSo why aren't you seeing the results you expected?\n\nHere's what most people don't realize:\n\n**The Problem:** Retail skincare products—even expensive ones—can only work on your skin's surface (epidermis). But the concerns you're trying to fix? They're happening deeper, in the dermis layer.\n\n→ Collagen loss (fine lines, sagging)\n→ Textural damage (acne scars, enlarged pores)\n→ Deep hyperpigmentation\n\nTopical products can't reach these layers. It's not their fault—it's just biology.\n\n**The Solution:** Professional treatments work at the dermis level where aging and damage actually occur.\n\n[TREATMENT_TYPE] targets [SPECIFIC_CONCERN] by [BRIEF_SCIENCE_EXPLANATION].\n\nThink of it this way:\n• Products = daily maintenance (essential)\n• Treatments = structural renovation (transformative)\n\nYou need both.\n\n**What This Means for You:**\n\nBased on your [PREVIOUS_CONSULTATION/SKIN_QUIZ] results, the most effective approach for your [SPECIFIC_CONCERN] combines:\n\n1. [RECOMMENDED_TREATMENT] every [FREQUENCY]\n2. Medical-grade [PRODUCT_TYPE] for home maintenance\n3.
