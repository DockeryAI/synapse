THE PAIN MYTH\nEveryone asks \"how bad does it hurt?\" but pain is the least important factor. I've seen 250lb men tap out on wrist tattoos and 110lb women sit through 8-hour rib pieces. Your pain tolerance is unique, and we work at your pace. Period.\n\n2. THE PINTEREST PROBLEM\nBringing reference images is great. Expecting an exact copy is not. Those viral tattoos look good because they were custom-designed for that person's body. Let us adapt the concept to YOU.\n\n3. THE SIZE MISTAKE\nSmaller is not always better for first tattoos. Tiny, intricate designs don't age well. That delicate fine-line flower will be a blob in 10 years. We'll tell you the truth even if you don't want to hear it.\n\n4. THE PRICE OBJECTION\nGood tattoos aren't cheap, and cheap tattoos aren't good. You're paying for:\n→ Years of apprenticeship and practice\n→ Medical-grade sterilization equipment\n→ Premium inks that won't fade to blue-green\n→ Insurance and licensing\n→ An artist who won't ghost you if there's an issue\n\n5. THE PLACEMENT REALITY\nHands, neck, and face tattoos are called \"job stoppers\" for a reason. Start somewhere you can cover. You can always get more visible later.\n\nI turn away 2-3 clients per week because what they want won't work. That's not being difficult—that's being professional.\n\nWhat questions do you have about getting your first tattoo?

Yep.\nAm I okay with that? Absolutely.\n\nHere's why:\n\nCLIENT #1: Hand tattoos are called \"job stoppers\" for a reason. I told him to get a few tattoos in coverable areas first, live with them for a year, then come back. If he still wants hands, I'll do it. But I won't be someone's regret story.\n\nCLIENT #2: Tiny portraits don't age well. In 5 years, it'll be a blurry blob. I showed her examples of small portraits after healing. She understood and we're now planning a larger, better piece.\n\nCLIENT #3: That viral tattoo you saw? It was custom-designed for that person's body. Copying it exactly is like wearing someone else's wedding dress. We can use it as inspiration and create something unique for you.\n\nAfter [NUMBER] years in this industry, I've learned:\n\nGood artists tell you what will work.\nGreat artists tell you what won't.\n\nYou're trusting me with something permanent. I take that seriously.\n\nIf you're planning a tattoo and want honest advice (even if it's not what you want to hear), let's talk.\n\n[BOOK CONSULTATION BUTTON]\n\nI'd rather lose a booking than create someone's future cover-up project.\n\n- [ARTIST NAME]\n[SHOP NAME]\n\nP.S. - All three clients thanked me later.
