        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nI just watched another homeowner pick paint colors that will cost them $8,000 when they sell.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nThey walked into the paint store, looked at swatches under fluorescent lighting, picked \"safe\" beige, and painted their entire exterior.\n\nTwo years later when they listed their house, their realtor said: \"The paint color is dated. You'll need to drop your price or repaint.\"\n\nTHE DATA DOESN'T LIE:\n\nZillow analyzed 135,000 home sales and found:\n\n✅ COLORS THAT INCREASE VALUE:\n• Navy blue exteriors: +$1,514 average\n• Charcoal gray: +$3,496 average\n• Soft blue bedrooms: +$1,856 average\n\n❌ COLORS THAT HURT VALUE:\n• Beige/brown combos: -$1,970 (screams 1990s)\n• Bright red: -$2,310\n• Terracotta: -$1,642\n\nBUT HERE'S THE REAL SECRET:\n\nIt's not just the color - it's testing it on YOUR home in YOUR lighting.\n\nWe painted 4x4 test patches on the Johnson's house at three different color temperatures. The \"perfect\" color from the store looked terrible in their north-facing light.\n\nThe right color? Increased their appraisal by $11,000.\n\nWANT OUR COLOR SELECTION PROCESS?\n\nWe're offering free color consultations this month for [CITY] homeowners. Here's what you get:\n\n✓ Test patches on your actual walls\n✓ Lighting analysis (morning/noon/evening)\n✓ Neighborhood comp research\n✓ ROI projections for each color option\n✓ Written recommendation with paint codes\n\nValue: $400. Your cost: $0 (if you book by April 15th)\n\n[SCHEDULE YOUR CONSULTATION]\n\nP.S. - We're also sending our \"Colors That Sell\" guide with specific paint codes and room-by-room recommendations.

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nAfter 15 years and 487 homes painted in [CITY], I've learned something that might surprise you:\n\nThe homeowners who are happiest 5 years later aren't the ones who picked their favorite colors.\n\nThey're the ones who followed a process.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nLAST MONTH: Two clients, same neighborhood, similar budgets.\n\nCLIENT A picked colors in 30 minutes at the paint store. Went with trendy dark gray and bright white trim. Looked amazing... for 18 months. Then:\n• Dark gray faded badly on south-facing walls\n• Bright white showed every speck of dirt\n• Neighbors all painted similar colors (no longer unique)\n• When they listed, realtor said it looked \"too trendy\"\n\nCLIENT B spent 2 weeks testing. We painted 4x4 samples, checked lighting at different times, researched neighborhood comps. Chose colors that:\n• Work with their home's architecture\n• Hide dirt and imperfections\n• Appeal to 80% of buyers\n• Have proven longevity (10+ year performance data)\n\nResult? Client B's home just sold for $43,000 over asking. Multiple buyers mentioned the \"beautiful, timeless paint colors.\"\n\nTHE DIFFERENCE? PROCESS.\n\nHere's our 3-step approach:\n\n1. ARCHITECTURE FIRST\nYour home's style dictates color palette. Craftsman homes need earth tones. Modern homes can handle bold. Colonial needs traditional.\n\n2. LIGHTING ANALYSIS  \nNorth-facing walls need warm colors. South-facing can handle cool tones. We test in morning, noon, and evening light.\n\n3. MARKET RESEARCH\nWhat colors are top-selling homes in your neighborhood using? We pull comp data before recommending anything.\n\nThis process takes 2 weeks. Most painters skip it entirely.\n\nWANT TO DO THIS RIGHT?\n\nWe're offering [NUMBER] free color consultations this quarter using our complete process:\n\n✓ Architectural style analysis\n✓ 4x4 test patches on your actual walls  \n✓ Lighting documentation (morning/noon/evening)\n✓ Neighborhood comp research\n✓ Written recommendation with ROI projections\n\nNormal cost: $400\nYour cost: $0 (consultation includes no-obligation quote)\n\n[BOOK YOUR CONSULTATION]\n\nThis isn't a sales pitch. Half the people we consult with don't hire us - but they don't make $15,000 color mistakes either.\n\nThat's worth 2 weeks of patience.\n\nBest,\n[YOUR NAME]\nCertified Color Consultant\n[COMPANY NAME]\n\nP.S. - I'm also sending our \"Color Selection Checklist\" - the exact questions to ask before committing to any color.

The one that made the whole block look dated?\n\nIt's now the best-looking home in the neighborhood.\n\nBEFORE:\n• Embarrassing peeling brown paint\n• HOA violation notices piling up  \n• Owners stressed about upcoming graduation party\n• Every painter booked 6-8 weeks out\n\nThey called us on Monday. Party was Saturday.\n\nWHAT WE DID:\n\nDAY 1 (Tuesday): Complete surface prep, moisture testing, primer application\nDAY 2 (Wednesday): Two coats Benjamin Moore Aura (Hale Navy + White Dove)\nDAY 3 (Thursday): Detail work, cleanup, final inspection\n\nFriday: Their house looked like a model home.\n\nSaturday: 50 graduation guests. Six neighbors asked for our number.\n\nTHE RESULT:\n\nThey're listing next month. Their realtor says the paint job will add $10,000-$12,000 to the sale price.\n\nROI: 340% on their $3,200 investment.\n\nHere's what the owner texted me:\n\n\"We had no idea paint could make this much difference.
