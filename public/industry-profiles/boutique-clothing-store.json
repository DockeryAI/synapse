THE BRIDGE PIECE\n→ One structured blazer or jacket in a neutral tone\n→ Elevates casual, professionalizes dressy\n→ Investment range: $[PRICE RANGE]\n\n2. THE FOUNDATION BOTTOM\n→ One perfectly-fitted trouser or jean\n→ Works for 80% of your life\n→ Investment range: $[PRICE RANGE]\n\n3. THE MULTIPLIER ACCESSORY\n→ One statement piece that transforms basics\n→ Belt, scarf, or jewelry that adds personality\n→ Investment range: $[PRICE RANGE]\n\nREAL RESULT: Client Sarah added these 3 pieces to her existing wardrobe and went from 5 outfits she felt good in to 15+.\n\nTotal investment: $[TOTAL]. Cost per new outfit: $[CALCULATION].\n\n**Want me to help you identify YOUR 3 pieces?**\n\nReply to this email with:\n→ Your lifestyle (work situation, social life, climate)\n→ Your biggest wardrobe gap\n→ Your budget range\n\nI'll personally respond with specific recommendations from our current collection.\n\nOr come see me in-store this week - I'm offering complimentary 15-minute wardrobe consultations through [DATE].\n\nXo,\n[OWNER_NAME]\n\nP.S. - We just got the perfect bridge blazer in 3 colors.

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nControversial take from a boutique owner:\n\nYou don't need more clothes. You need better ones.\n\nAfter [NUMBER] years doing this, I can spot the difference between a woman who owns 100 pieces and wears 10, versus one who owns 30 and wears them all.\n\nThe difference isn't the quantity. It's the intention.\n\n**HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED:**\n\nThe women who walk out of here feeling most confident aren't buying the most. They're buying the RIGHT pieces.\n\nThey ask:\n→ 'Where will I wear this in the next 2 weeks?'\n→ 'What 5 things in my closet does this work with?'\n→ 'Will I still love this in 2 years?'\n→ 'Does this make me feel like the best version of myself?'\n\nIf it's not yes to all four, they walk away.\n\nAnd you know what? They spend LESS annually than the woman buying 'just because it's on sale.'\n\n**THE SHIFT:**\n\nFrom: Accumulation → To: Curation\nFrom: Trends → To: Timelessness\nFrom: Quantity → To: Quality\nFrom: Cheap thrills → To: Investment pieces\n\nThis is the philosophy behind every piece we stock.\n\nOur [SEASONAL] Collection embodies this completely. [NUMBER] pieces. Each one passed the 4-question test.\n\n**VIP EARLY ACCESS:** [DATE] at [TIME]\nPublic launch: [DATE]\n\n[SHOP EARLY ACCESS LINK]\n\nLet's build your intentional wardrobe together.\n\n[OWNER_NAME]\n\nP.S. - Sizing note: These run [TRUE TO SIZE/SMALL/LARGE].
