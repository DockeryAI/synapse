LIENS & JUDGMENTS: Old contractor liens, tax liens, HOA liens—these don't disappear automatically.\n\n✅ 3. EASEMENTS: Who has the right to use your property and for what? This affects where you can build, fence, or landscape.\n\n✅ 4. RESTRICTIONS & COVENANTS: Can you run a business from home? Paint your house purple? These rules are enforceable.\n\n✅ 5. LEGAL DESCRIPTION: Does it match the survey? Mismatches = you might not be buying what you think.\n\n✅ 6. EXCEPTIONS: What is your title insurance NOT covering? These are your risks.\n\n✅ 7. PROPERTY TAXES: Are they current? Who pays the prorated amount?\n\nReal story: Found a [NUMBER]-year-old mechanics lien on a property 2 days before closing.

Cost to fix: $[AMOUNT].\n\n**What I'm recommending instead:**\n\n→ [NUMBER]-day minimum from contract to closing\n→ [NUMBER]-day inspection period (not [NUMBER])\n→ Title review completed [NUMBER] days before closing\n→ Final walkthrough [NUMBER] days prior, not [NUMBER] hours\n\n**The pushback I get:**\n\n\"But we'll lose the house!\"\n\nMaybe. But I've had [NUMBER] clients this year who rushed to close and then spent $[AMOUNT]+ fixing problems that should have been caught.\n\nA house you lose to another buyer is disappointing.\n\nA house you're stuck with that has $[AMOUNT] in hidden problems is devastating.\n\n**My offer to you:**\n\nIf you're in a rushed closing situation, let me review your timeline and documents. I'll tell you honestly if the speed is worth the risk or if you need to pump the brakes.\n\n**[CTA_BUTTON: Review My Closing Timeline]**\n\nNo charge for the timeline analysis—just reply with your closing date and I'll assess the risk.\n\nLooking out for you,\n\n[ATTORNEY_NAME]\n\nP.S. If you're a real estate agent reading this, let's talk about how rushed closings are affecting your clients long-term. I'm happy to do a training for your team.\n\n---\n\nFRAMEWORK: Thought leadership | SEGMENT: Subscribers + referral partners",
