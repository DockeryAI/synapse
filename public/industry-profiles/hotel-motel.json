        "template": "💡 TRAVEL HACK: How to avoid hidden hotel fees (and actually get what you paid for)\n\nSaw someone in our local group asking about surprise resort fees last week. Here's what actually works:\n\n✅ ASK THESE 3 QUESTIONS BEFORE BOOKING:\n\n1. \"What's the TOTAL price including all fees?\"\n(Resort fees, parking, WiFi, etc. should be disclosed upfront)\n\n2. \"What's included in the rate?\"\n(Breakfast, parking, cancellation - get specifics)\n\n3. \"Can you send me written confirmation?\"\n(Screenshot everything. Seriously.)\n\n🚨 RED FLAGS TO AVOID:\n• \"Mandatory resort fee\" not shown until checkout\n• Vague \"taxes and fees may apply\" language\n• Parking listed as \"available\" (doesn't mean free!)\n• \"Continental breakfast\" (could be coffee and stale muffins)\n\n✨ WHAT TO LOOK FOR:\n• \"All-inclusive rate\" or \"No hidden fees\"\n• Specific amenity descriptions\n• Free cancellation terms clearly stated\n• Recent photos (not 5 years old)\n• Responses to negative reviews (shows they care)\n\nPRO TIP: Book direct when possible. Hotels can often match OTA prices AND throw in extras (free breakfast, parking, upgrades) because they're not paying 15-25% commission.\n\nOur policy: One transparent price. Everything included. If we charge you something that wasn't disclosed upfront, your stay is free. Period.\n\nWhat's the worst hidden fee you've encountered? Share below so others can avoid it! 👇\n\n(And yes, we're a local hotel tired of seeing travelers get burned by sneaky pricing. Feel free to ask us anything about booking smart!)"

Here's what most hotels won't tell you:\n\n📱 BOOKING CHANNELS MATTER:\n• Book through OTA: We pay 15-25% commission (yes, really)\n• Book direct: We save that money and can offer you perks\n• Call directly: Best chance for upgrades and special requests\n\n🛏️ ROOM ASSIGNMENT SECRETS:\n• Loyalty members get first pick of premium rooms\n• Special occasion mentions (anniversary, birthday) = upgrade priority\n• Early check-in requests noted in system get priority\n• Polite guests remembered by name get better service\n\n✨ THE UPGRADE GAME:\n• We WANT to upgrade you (empty premium rooms = lost revenue)\n• Best upgrade chances: Sunday-Thursday, off-season, direct bookings\n• Joining loyalty program (even free tier) = 3x more likely to get upgraded\n• Asking nicely at check-in works more than you think\n\n🧹 CLEANLINESS REALITY:\n• Post-2020, we spend 40% more time per room on cleaning\n• \"Spotlessly clean or stay free\" isn't marketing - it's our actual policy\n• Housekeeping staff are trained monthly on updated protocols\n• You can request to see cleaning checklists (we're proud of them)\n\n💰 PRICING TRUTH:\n• Rates change based on demand (like airline tickets)\n• Booking 3-6 weeks out usually gets best rates\n• Last-minute deals exist but risky for popular dates\n• Direct booking price match guarantee is real\n\nWHY AM I SHARING THIS?\n\nBecause informed guests are happier guests. And happy guests come back, leave great reviews, and tell their friends.\n\nWe'd rather have you book smart and trust us than play games and leave disappointed.\n\nQuestions about hotel booking?

We'll match it AND give you an additional 10% off. No questions asked.\n\n[BOOK DIRECT - SAVE NOW]\n\nP.S. - Already booked through an OTA? Call us at [PHONE] before [DATE] and we'll see if we can switch you to our direct rate and save you money.\n\nYour wallet will thank you,\n[SIGNATURE]\n\n---\n\nP.P.S. - Forward this to anyone planning a trip.
