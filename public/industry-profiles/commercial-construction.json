Don't call contractors yet.\n\nI've seen too many businesses rush into construction and regret it. Here's what to do in the 90 days BEFORE you talk to builders:\n\n**DAYS 1-30: GET CLEAR ON YOUR NEEDS**\n□ Document your current space problems (be specific)\n□ Project your growth for next 5 years (revenue, employees, equipment)\n□ Survey your team about workflow pain points\n□ List your must-haves vs nice-to-haves\n□ Set a realistic budget range (construction + equipment + contingency)\n\n**DAYS 31-60: DO YOUR HOMEWORK**\n□ Research zoning for potential sites or your current location\n□ Talk to your bank about construction financing options\n□ Look at 3-5 competitors' or similar businesses' facilities\n□ Identify your project timeline drivers (lease expiration, growth, compliance)\n□ Start a project folder with all your notes and research\n\n**DAYS 61-90: PREPARE FOR CONVERSATIONS**\n□ Develop your project brief (1-2 pages max)\n□ Get your financial documents organized for lender\n□ Create a list of questions for contractors\n□ Research design-build vs design-bid-build\n□ Identify 3-5 contractors to interview (not just get bids from)\n\nWhy 90 days? Because owners who do this work upfront:\n✅ Get better pricing (you know what you actually need)\n✅ Avoid expensive changes mid-project\n✅ Secure financing faster\n✅ Choose the right partner, not just the cheapest bid\n✅ Stay on schedule and budget\n\nThe owners who skip this? They're the ones posting in here 8 months later asking \"How do I fire my contractor?\" 😬\n\nQuestions? Drop them below.

That seems insane. What am I missing?\"\n\nYou're not missing anything. That's the market.\n\nHere's what's driving commercial construction costs in [REGION] in 2024:\n\n**MATERIAL COSTS (up 18% since 2022)**\n• Structural steel: $2.20-$2.80/lb\n• Concrete: $140-$180/cubic yard\n• Lumber: Still 40% above pre-2020 prices\n\n**LABOR COSTS (up 22% since 2022)**\n• Skilled trades shortage = premium wages\n• Benefits and insurance up 15%\n• Overtime often required to meet schedules\n\n**SOFT COSTS (often forgotten)**\n• Permits and fees: $8-$15/SF depending on jurisdiction\n• Engineering and architecture: 8-12% of construction\n• Financing costs during construction\n• Insurance and bonding\n\n**CURRENT COST PER SF IN [MARKET]:**\n→ Basic warehouse/industrial: $110-$145/SF\n→ Office/retail: $165-$225/SF\n→ Specialized (food service, medical): $225-$350/SF\n\nThese are ALL-IN costs including site work, utilities, basic finishes.\n\n**THE GOOD NEWS:**\n\n1. Prices are stabilizing (not dropping, but not spiking monthly like 2021-2022)\n2. Guaranteed Maximum Price contracts protect you from increases\n3. Value engineering can cut 10-15% without sacrificing quality\n4. Pre-engineered buildings offer savings for the right applications\n\n**THE BAD NEWS:**\n\nIf you're budgeting based on what construction cost in 2019, add 35-40% to be realistic.\n\n**WHAT TO DO:**\n\nGet a feasibility study BEFORE you fall in love with a plan. Spend $5K-$10K upfront to know real costs for YOUR project with YOUR site conditions.\n\nIt's way better than getting 6 months into design and realizing you can't afford to build it.\n\nWhat are you seeing in your market?

They had outgrown their space anyway, but the numbers looked impossible:\n\n• Their budget: $2.1M\n• Initial design they loved: $3.4M\n• Timeline requirement: 12 months (had to be out of old lease)\n• Complication: Needed to stay operational during construction\n\n\"We can't afford this\" was their exact quote.\n\n**WHAT WE DID:**\n\nInstead of walking away, we spent 6 weeks in pre-construction services:\n\n✅ Value-engineered the design (kept 90% of functionality at 65% of cost)\n✅ Identified a better site with existing utilities (saved $180K)\n✅ Proposed phased construction to keep them operational\n✅ Locked in a Guaranteed Maximum Price: $2.3M\n✅ Created a payment schedule that worked with their cash flow\n\n**THE RESULTS:**\n\n→ Moved in 13.5 months from first meeting (on time)\n→ Final cost: $2.26M (under budget)\n→ Zero days of operational shutdown\n→ LEED Silver certified (saving $31K/year in utilities)\n→ Building appraised at $3.1M (instant equity)\n\nBut here's what the numbers don't show:\n\n\"Our employees are PROUD to come to work now. We're landing bigger clients because we look professional. And I sleep better knowing we own this - no landlord can ever put us in that position again.\" - [CLIENT NAME], CEO\n\n**THE LESSON:**\n\n\"We can't afford this\" usually means \"we don't see how to make this work yet.\"\n\nThat's where the right partner makes all the difference.\n\n---\n\nFacing a similar situation?

Don't miss these line items that add 15-25% to your project cost\n\n---\n\nHi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nYou've got your construction budget approved. The contractor's bid looks reasonable. You're ready to move forward.\n\nThen the \"extras\" start appearing.\n\nI've seen this derail too many projects. Here are the 5 costs that almost everyone forgets to budget for:\n\n**1. SITE WORK SURPRISES ($40K-$150K)**\n• Soil conditions different than expected\n• Rock excavation\n• Underground utilities in wrong location\n• Stormwater management requirements\n\n→ SOLUTION: Invest $8K-$15K in geotechnical study BEFORE you finalize design\n\n**2. PERMIT FEES & IMPACT FEES ($15K-$80K)**\n• Building permits (obvious)\n• Impact fees for roads, schools, utilities (not obvious)\n• Plan review fees\n• Inspection fees\n\n→ SOLUTION: Call the building department early - get fee schedule in writing\n\n**3. UTILITY CONNECTION COSTS ($30K-$200K)**\n• Bringing power to the site\n• Water/sewer tap fees\n• Gas line extensions\n• Telecom infrastructure\n\n→ SOLUTION: Contact utility companies 6+ months ahead - some have 12-month lead times\n\n**4. FURNITURE, FIXTURES & EQUIPMENT ($25-$75/SF)**\n• Office furniture\n• Warehouse racking\n• Specialized equipment installation\n• Technology infrastructure\n\n→ SOLUTION: Budget this separately from construction - it's often 15-20% of building cost\n\n**5. SOFT COSTS DURING CONSTRUCTION ($$$)**\n• Continued rent at current location\n• Construction loan interest\n• Insurance during construction\n• Project management time (your time has value)\n\n→ SOLUTION: Create a month-by-month cash flow projection including ALL costs\n\n**THE BOTTOM LINE:**\n\nIf your contractor quotes $2M for construction, your all-in cost is likely $2.4M-$2.6M.\n\nPlan for it now, or scramble for cash later.\n\n**WHAT TO DO NEXT:**\n\nDownload our Construction Budget Worksheet - it includes every line item you need to consider:\n\n[BUTTON: Download Free Budget Worksheet]\n\nOr reply to this email with your project details and I'll help you think through the hidden costs specific to your situation.\n\nNo sales pitch - just helpful budget planning.\n\n[SIGNATURE]\n\nP.S.

Here's the data.\n\n**WE ANALYZED 127 COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ($50M+ total value) completed in [REGION] over the past 3 years:**\n\n**TRADITIONAL COMPETITIVE BID:**\n• 61% finished within 10% of original budget\n• Average cost overrun: 14.3%\n• 23% exceeded budget by 20%+\n• Average change orders: $187K per $1M of construction\n\n**GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE:**\n• 94% finished within 5% of GMP\n• Average cost overrun: 2.1%\n• Only 3% exceeded GMP (due to owner-requested changes)\n• Average change orders: $41K per $1M of construction\n\n**WHAT THIS MEANS IN REAL DOLLARS:**\n\n$2M Traditional Bid:\n→ Likely final cost: $2.28M (14.3% overrun)\n→ Budget uncertainty throughout project\n→ Potential cash flow crisis\n\n$2.08M GMP (4% premium):\n→ Likely final cost: $2.12M (2.1% overrun)\n→ Budget certainty from day one\n→ Easier financing approval\n\n**The \"expensive\" GMP is actually $160K cheaper.**\n\n**WHY GMP WORKS:**\n\n1. **Contractor has skin in the game** - overruns come from their profit\n2. **Scope is fully defined upfront** - no \"that's extra\" surprises\n3. **Collaborative problem-solving** - you're partners, not adversaries\n4. **Banks love them** - easier to secure construction financing\n\n**WHEN GMP MAKES SENSE:**\n\n✓ Project budget is fixed (board approval, loan commitment)\n✓ Timeline is critical (lease expiration, seasonal business)\n✓ You need financing (banks require budget certainty)\n✓ You're risk-averse (can't absorb 20% cost overrun)\n\n**WHEN LOW BID MIGHT WORK:**\n\n✓ You have 20%+ contingency budget\n✓ Timeline is flexible\n✓ You have construction expertise in-house\n✓ Simple, well-defined scope\n\n**THE QUESTION ISN'T \"CAN I AFFORD THE GMP PREMIUM?\"**\n\n**IT'S \"CAN I AFFORD THE RISK OF NOT HAVING ONE?\"**\n\nFor most business owners building their first or second facility, the answer is no.\n\n**WANT TO DISCUSS YOUR SPECIFIC PROJECT?**\n\nReply to this email with:\n• Your project scope\n• Your budget range\n• Your timeline\n\nI'll send you a personalized analysis of whether GMP makes sense for your situation.\n\nNo obligation, no sales pressure.\n\n[SIGNATURE]\n\nP.S.
