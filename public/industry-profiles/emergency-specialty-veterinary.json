By 11 PM, he was pacing, drooling, trying to vomit with nothing coming up.\n\nSarah almost waited until morning. Almost.\n\nBut she'd seen our post about bloat symptoms and knew: distended belly + unproductive vomiting = EMERGENCY.\n\nShe was right. Max had GDV (gastric dilatation-volvulus). His stomach had twisted. Without surgery, he had maybe 2 hours.\n\nHere's what happened next:\n\n11:52 PM - Triage confirmed GDV\n12:03 AM - IV lines placed, stabilization started\n12:45 AM - In surgery with Dr. [NAME], our board-certified surgeon\n2:18 AM - Surgery complete, stomach untwisted and secured\n2:30 AM - Moved to ICU with continuous monitoring\n\nToday? Max went home. Running, playing, being the goofball Great Dane Sarah knows and loves.\n\nThe difference between life and death was Sarah recognizing the symptoms and not waiting.\n\n⏰ TIME MATTERS WITH BLOAT:\n• 0-2 hours: Excellent survival rate with surgery\n• 2-6 hours: Survival rate drops significantly\n• 6+ hours: Often too late, even with surgery\n\n🚨 KNOW THESE SIGNS (especially large/deep-chested dogs):\n→ Distended, hard belly\n→ Trying to vomit but nothing comes up\n→ Excessive drooling\n→ Pacing, restlessness, can't get comfortable\n→ Rapid breathing\n→ Pale gums\n\nIf you see these symptoms: CALL US IMMEDIATELY. Don't wait. Don't \"see if it gets better.\"\n\nSarah's message to other pet parents: \"Trust your gut. I almost talked myself out of going because I didn't want to overreact.

Here's the truth about what happens when you walk through our doors:\n\n1️⃣ IMMEDIATE TRIAGE (within 5 minutes)\nA vet tech assesses your pet's vital signs and condition. Critical cases go straight back. Stable cases wait comfortably - just like human ERs, we see the sickest first.\n\n2️⃣ YOU'LL TALK TO A VET (within 15-30 minutes for stable cases)\nWe'll ask questions, do a physical exam, and explain what we're seeing. You're not bothering us. This is literally what we're here for.\n\n3️⃣ WE'LL DISCUSS OPTIONS & COSTS\nBefore we do anything, you'll know:\n→ What we recommend and why\n→ What it will cost (estimates provided)\n→ What happens if you decline treatment\n→ Payment options available\n\nNo surprises. No judgment. Just information so you can decide.\n\n4️⃣ TREATMENT & MONITORING\nDepending on the situation:\n→ Diagnostics (bloodwork, x-rays, ultrasound)\n→ Stabilization (IV fluids, oxygen, medications)\n→ Surgery if needed (board-certified surgeons)\n→ ICU care with continuous monitoring\n\n5️⃣ COMMUNICATION\nWe update you throughout the process. If your pet stays overnight, you'll get calls/texts with updates. We know you can't sleep when your pet is here - we try to give you peace of mind.\n\n6️⃣ COORDINATION WITH YOUR REGULAR VET\nWe send detailed reports to your primary vet. We're not trying to \"steal\" you - we're the ER, they're your primary care. You'll go back to them for follow-up.\n\n💰 ABOUT COST:\nYes, emergency care costs more than daytime appointments. Here's why:\n→ 24/7 staffing (overnight/weekend/holiday pay)\n→ Specialized equipment on-site\n→ Board-certified specialists available\n→ ICU-level monitoring and care\n\nWe offer:\n✓ Payment plans through [FINANCING COMPANY]\n✓ Work with all major pet insurance companies\n✓ Transparent estimates before treatment\n✓ Options at different price points when possible\n\n❤️ OUR PROMISE:\nYou'll never be judged for:\n→ Coming in for something that turns out minor (we'd rather check!)\n→ Asking questions (ask away!)\n→ Financial constraints (we'll work with you)\n→ Being emotional (we get it, we're pet parents too)\n\nYou'll be treated like family during the worst moments of pet parenthood.\n\n📞 SAVE THESE NUMBERS NOW:\nEmergency Line: [PHONE] (call anytime, we're always here)\nAddress: [ADDRESS]\nText for non-urgent questions: [NUMBER]\n\n🔖 SAVE this post for when you need it.

These 5 symptoms mean call us NOW, not tomorrow morning:\n\n🚨 1. DIFFICULTY BREATHING\n→ Gasping, blue/pale gums, extended neck\n→ Why it's urgent: Minutes matter with oxygen deprivation\n→ Common causes: Heart failure, airway obstruction, trauma\n\n🚨 2. UNABLE TO URINATE (especially male cats)\n→ Straining in litter box, crying, no urine production  \n→ Why it's urgent: Bladder can rupture within 24-48 hours\n→ This is THE most common \"I waited too long\" emergency we see\n\n🚨 3. SEIZURES (especially multiple or lasting >5 minutes)\n→ Convulsions, loss of consciousness, paddling legs\n→ Why it's urgent: Can indicate poisoning, brain issues, or status epilepticus\n→ Even if seizure stops, underlying cause needs immediate diagnosis\n\n🚨 4. BLOAT SYMPTOMS (large dogs)\n→ Distended hard belly + unproductive vomiting + pacing\n→ Why it's urgent: 2-hour window for life-saving surgery\n→ Survival rate drops dramatically after 6 hours\n\n🚨 5. SEVERE TRAUMA\n→ Hit by car, attacked by another animal, fall from height\n→ Why it's urgent: Internal injuries aren't always visible\n→ Shock can set in hours after incident\n\n---\n\nWHAT TO DO:\n\n1. Call us immediately: [PHONE] (24/7, always answered)\n2. Describe symptoms - we'll tell you if you need to come now\n3. Drive safely - we'll prep while you're en route\n4. Bring current medications and your regular vet's contact info\n\n---\n\nWHAT ABOUT COST?\n\nWe get it. Emergency care is expensive. Here's what we offer:\n\n✓ Transparent estimates BEFORE treatment\n✓ Payment plans through [FINANCING_COMPANY]  \n✓ Work with all major pet insurance\n✓ Treatment options at different price points when possible\n\nYour pet's life comes first.

        "body": "Subject: Board-certified vet: The bloat myth that's costing dog lives\n\nPreview: Why \"wait and see\" is the deadliest advice for GDV\n\n---\n\nDear [FIRST_NAME],\n\nI need to bust a dangerous myth that I see kill dogs every month.\n\nMyth: \"If it's really bloat, you'll know. The symptoms are obvious.\"\n\nReality: Early bloat symptoms look like indigestion. By the time it's \"obvious,\" you may have missed the critical window.\n\nLet me explain what actually happens (this might save your dog's life):\n\n---\n\nTHE TIMELINE OF BLOAT:\n\nSTAGE 1 (0-30 minutes):\n→ Restlessness, mild pacing\n→ Attempts to vomit (may bring up foam)\n→ Slight abdominal discomfort\n\n❌ What owners think: \"He ate too fast again\"\n✅ What's happening: Stomach filling with gas\n\nSTAGE 2 (30-90 minutes):  \n→ Distended abdomen (feels tight like a drum)\n→ Unproductive retching (the KEY sign)\n→ Excessive drooling\n→ Rapid breathing\n\n❌ What owners think: \"Let's see if it passes\"\n✅ What's happening: Stomach may be twisting (GDV)\n\nSTAGE 3 (90+ minutes):\n→ Pale gums\n→ Weakness, collapse  \n→ Rapid heart rate\n→ Shock setting in\n\n❌ What owners think: \"We need to go NOW\"\n✅ What's happening: Often too late for good outcomes\n\n---\n\nTHE SURVIVAL STATISTICS:\n\nTreatment within 2 hours: 90-95% survival rate\nTreatment at 2-6 hours: 60-70% survival rate  \nTreatment after 6 hours: 30-50% survival rate\n\nThe difference between Stage 1 and Stage 3? Often less than 2 hours.\n\n---\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\nIF YOUR DOG SHOWS THESE SIGNS:\n✓ Trying to vomit but nothing comes up\n✓ Distended, hard belly\n✓ Pacing and can't get comfortable\n\nCALL US IMMEDIATELY: [PHONE]\n\nDon't \"wait and see.\" Don't Google. Don't post in Facebook groups asking if it's serious.\n\nCall. We'd rather you come in for a false alarm than arrive too late.\n\n---\n\nHIGH-RISK BREEDS:\n→ Great Danes (highest risk)\n→ German Shepherds  \n→ Standard Poodles\n→ Weimaraners\n→ Irish Setters\n→ Any large, deep-chested breed\n\nBut ANY dog can bloat. I've seen it in 30-pound mixed breeds.\n\n---\n\nWHAT WE DO:\n\n1. Immediate stabilization (IV fluids, decompression)\n2. X-rays to confirm GDV\n3. Emergency surgery to untwist stomach  \n4. Gastropexy (stomach tacked to prevent recurrence)\n5. ICU monitoring for 24-48 hours\n\nWith early intervention, outcomes are excellent.\nWith delayed treatment, we're fighting for every percentage point.\n\n---\n\n📞 SAVE THIS NUMBER: [PHONE] (24/7)\n📍 [ADDRESS]\n\nForward this email to anyone with a large-breed dog. It could save a life.\n\nDr. [VET_NAME], DACVECC\nBoard-Certified Emergency & Critical Care\n[HOSPITAL_NAME]\n\nP.S. We offer preventive gastropexy (stomach tacking) for high-risk breeds.
