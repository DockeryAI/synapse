Almost every time.\n\nHere's the trick:\n\n**They make their first offer when you're most vulnerable.**\n\nYou're in pain. Medical bills are piling up. You're missing work. You're scared.\n\nThen they call with an offer. It sounds like a lot of money. They make it seem urgent - \"This offer expires in 48 hours\" or \"We need your answer by Friday.\"\n\nSo you accept it.\n\nHere's what they're not telling you:\n\n→ That \"urgent\" deadline? Completely made up.\n→ That \"generous\" offer? It's their LOWEST acceptable number.\n→ Those future medical costs? Not included in their calculation.\n\nReal example from last month:\n\nClient injured in rear-end collision. $23,000 in medical bills. Still in physical therapy. First offer: $8,500.\n\nThey accepted our representation. We documented ongoing treatment, future care needs, and lost wages. Settlement: $67,000.\n\nSame injuries. Same insurance company. 8X more money.\n\nThe difference? We knew what the case was actually worth.\n\n**If you've been in an accident, here's what to do:**\n\n1. Do NOT accept the first offer (or even the second)\n2. Do NOT give a recorded statement without legal advice\n3. Do NOT sign a release until you know your full damages\n4. DO document everything (photos, medical records, expenses)\n5. DO get a free case evaluation before deciding\n\nYour case is worth more than their first offer. Always.\n\nWe offer free consultations with no obligation. We'll review your situation, tell you what we think it's worth, and explain your options.\n\nEven if you decide not to hire us, you'll know whether their offer is fair.\n\n[CTA BUTTON: Get Free Case Evaluation]\n\nOr call us directly: [PHONE_NUMBER]\n\nAvailable [AVAILABILITY] because insurance companies don't wait, and neither should you.\n\nFighting for you,\n\n[ATTORNEY_NAME]\n[FIRM_NAME]\n[CREDENTIALS]\n\nP.S. - Forward this to anyone who's been in an accident recently.
