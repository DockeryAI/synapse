It's a health crisis.\n\nThose tight mats? They're pulling on your dog's skin 24/7, creating moisture traps where bacteria and fungus THRIVE. I've seen infections, hot spots, and even skin tears from severe matting.\n\nHere's what to watch for:\n✅ Skin redness or hot spots under mats\n✅ Your dog flinching when you touch certain areas  \n✅ A musty odor coming from the coat\n✅ Excessive scratching or licking\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS: This is 100% preventable!\n\nFor [BREED TYPE] dogs, professional grooming every [X] weeks + at-home brushing 3x weekly keeps mats away.
