We win at PERSONALIZATION.\n\nNow, instead of trying to have the fastest wifi, I focus on:\n\n→ Remembering that you take your coffee black\n→ Knowing you're celebrating your 10th anniversary\n→ Recommending the hiking trail that matches YOUR fitness level\n→ Making breakfast that works for YOUR dietary needs\n→ Giving you the quiet room because you mentioned you're a light sleeper\n\nThis approach has completely transformed our business:\n- [X]% of our guests are now repeat visitors or referrals\n- Our reviews mention me by name [X]% of the time\n- We're booked solid during [PEAK_SEASON] 8 weeks in advance\n\nBut more importantly? Guests leave different than they arrived.\n\nLighter. Reconnected. Restored.\n\nThat's not something you can standardize.\n\nIf you've been considering a visit to [B&B_NAME], I'd love to learn what would make your stay perfect. Just reply to this email.\n\nOur [SEASON] calendar is open, and I'm already planning the seasonal menu.\n\n[INNKEEPER_NAME]\n\n[LINK TO AVAILABILITY]\n\nP.S. I keep notes on every guest. Your coffee preference, your anniversary date, your favorite breakfast item. When you return (and most people do), I'll remember.",
