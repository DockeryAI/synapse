Jacket sleeves covering your shirt cuff (hides your watch, looks sloppy)\n3. Pants breaking more than once on your shoes (dated, unprofessional)\n4.

Trouser rise sitting too low (modern cut, but unprofessional for traditional industries)\n\nAGITATE: Studies show first impressions form in 7 seconds.

Here's what most people don't realize about off-the-rack clothing:\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\nMass-produced clothing is designed for \"average\" body proportions. But here's the thing—almost nobody is actually \"average.\" You might be:\n→ Taller with longer arms\n→ Athletic build with broader shoulders\n→ Shorter with different rise needs\n→ Between sizes in different areas\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\nIll-fitting clothes don't just look wrong—they feel uncomfortable and undermine your confidence. That expensive suit you never wear? It's probably not the style. It's the fit.\n\nTHE SOLUTION:\nProfessional alterations can fix:\n✓ Shoulders that are too wide or narrow\n✓ Sleeves that cover your hands\n✓ Pants that drag or bunch\n✓ Jackets that pull or gap\n✓ Waists that need taking in or letting out\n\nMost alterations cost [15-30%] of the garment price but make it look like it was custom-made for you.\n\nQUESTION: What fit problems frustrate you most?

Vanity sizing means a \"medium\" at one brand is a \"large\" at another\n2. Your size changes between brands, styles, and even seasons\n3. Off-the-rack sizing assumes proportions that don't match real bodies\n4. \"Perfect fit\" off the rack is actually rare—maybe 5% of people\n\nSo what do successful, well-dressed people do differently?\n\nThey buy for the largest part of their body, then alter everything else.\n\n→ Broad shoulders? Buy for shoulders, tailor the waist\n→ Long torso? Buy for length, adjust everywhere else\n→ Athletic build? Buy for chest, taper the rest\n\nThis is why CEOs and celebrities always look perfectly put together. It's not better genetics or expensive clothes—it's expert alterations.\n\nThe transformation:\n→ $200 suit + $100 alterations = looks like $1,000\n→ $800 suit with no alterations = looks like $200\n\nFit beats fabric. Every. Single. Time.\n\nI'm offering FREE fit consultations this week for anyone tired of clothes that don't work.

We see it constantly—expensive purchases that never get worn because they don't fit quite right.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\nYou bought a $[XXX] suit/dress for [important event]. It looked good in the store under perfect lighting with the sales associate telling you it was \"great.\" But at home? The shoulders are slightly off. The sleeves are too long. It just doesn't feel right.\n\nSo it hangs there. Unworn. A $[XXX] mistake.\n\nTHE TRUTH:\nOff-the-rack clothing is designed for \"average\" proportions. But you're not average—you're unique. Your body deserves clothes that fit YOUR proportions, not some manufacturer's statistical model.\n\nTHE SOLUTION:\nProfessional alterations transform \"almost right\" into \"absolutely perfect.\"\n\nFor $[XX-XXX] (typically 15-30% of garment cost), we can:\n→ Adjust shoulders for natural fit\n→ Shorten or lengthen sleeves to proper proportion  \n→ Taper or let out for ideal silhouette\n→ Hem to perfect length\n→ Fix any fit issue preventing you from wearing it\n\nREAL EXAMPLE:\nClient brought in $800 suit purchased for promotion. Never wore it—shoulders too wide, sleeves too long. $175 in alterations later? It's now his go-to power outfit. Wore it to his first board presentation.\n\nInvestment saved: $800\nConfidence gained: Priceless\n\nYOUR NEXT STEP:\nBring in ONE piece from your closet that you love but don't wear.
