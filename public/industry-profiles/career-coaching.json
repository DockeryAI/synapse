Actually looked at it through a recruiter's eyes.\n\nBecause here's what I know after reviewing [NUMBER]+ resumes:\n\nMost people fail the [NUMBER]-second test.\n\nRecruiters spend an average of 7.4 seconds on your resume before deciding if you move forward.\n\n7.4 seconds.\n\nHere's what they look for (in order):\n\n1. [SPECIFIC ELEMENT]\n→ Why it matters: [EXPLANATION]\n→ What to do: [ACTION STEP]\n\n2. [SPECIFIC ELEMENT]\n→ Why it matters: [EXPLANATION]\n→ What to do: [ACTION STEP]\n\n3. [SPECIFIC ELEMENT]\n→ Why it matters: [EXPLANATION]\n→ What to do: [ACTION STEP]\n\nTHE TRUTH:\n\nYour resume isn't a job description. It's a highlight reel.\n\nEvery line should answer: \"So what? Why does this matter?\"\n\nExample:\n❌ \"Managed a team of 10\"\n✅ \"Led 10-person team to exceed quarterly targets by [PERCENTAGE]%, generating $[AMOUNT] in new revenue\"\n\nSee the difference?\n\nTHIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE:\n\nOpen your resume right now. Set a timer for 7.4 seconds. Look at it.\n\nWhat stands out? What would YOU remember?\n\nIf the answer is \"not much,\" it's time for a refresh.\n\nI've created a free resume audit checklist that covers all [NUMBER] elements recruiters actually look for. Download it here: [LINK]\n\nOr hit reply and send me your resume. I'll give you my honest [NUMBER]-minute take on what's working and what's not.\n\nYour resume is your first impression. Make it count.\n\n[YOUR_NAME]\n\nP.S. Next week I'm breaking down the [TOPIC] mistake I see on LinkedIn profiles. Stay tuned.",

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nLet me guess:\n\nYou've applied to [NUMBER]+ jobs in the last [TIMEFRAME].\n\nYou're qualified. Maybe overqualified.\n\nBut you're hearing crickets.\n\nHere's why:\n\n[PERCENTAGE]% of jobs are filled through referrals and internal networks before they ever hit job boards.\n\nYou're not competing with [NUMBER] candidates.\n\nYou're applying to the leftovers.\n\nThe roles they couldn't fill through their network.\n\nI know that's frustrating to hear. But here's the good news:\n\nYou can access the hidden job market. You just need a different strategy.\n\nHERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:\n\n1. STRATEGIC NETWORKING (not random connecting)\n\nMy client [CLIENT_NAME] landed her role at [COMPANY] by:\n→ Identifying [NUMBER] target companies\n→ Finding [NUMBER] people at each company (not HR, actual employees)\n→ Sending [NUMBER]-sentence messages offering value, not asking for jobs\n→ Having [NUMBER] coffee chats\n→ Getting [NUMBER] warm intro to the hiring manager\n\nTotal applications submitted: 0\nTime to offer: [TIMEFRAME]\n\n2. DIRECT OUTREACH (skip the black hole)\n\n[CLIENT_NAME] found the hiring manager on LinkedIn, researched their biggest challenge (from company earnings call), and sent this:\n\n\"Hi [NAME], I noticed [COMPANY] is expanding into [MARKET]. I've helped [PREVIOUS_COMPANY] grow [METRIC] by [PERCENTAGE]% in a similar expansion. Would you be open to a [NUMBER]-minute conversation about your strategy?\"\n\nResponse rate: [PERCENTAGE]%\nInterview rate: [PERCENTAGE]%\n\n3. REFERRAL GENERATION (the multiplier)\n\nYou don't need to know someone at your target company.\n\nYou need to know someone who knows someone.\n\n[CLIENT_NAME] used this approach:\n→ Listed [NUMBER] target companies\n→ Searched LinkedIn for 2nd-degree connections at each\n→ Asked for [NUMBER] intros per week\n→ Turned [NUMBER] intros into [NUMBER] referrals\n\nResult: [NUMBER] interviews in [TIMEFRAME]\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\n\nYour resume gets you in the door.\n\nYour network opens the door before you knock.\n\nI've put together a complete Hidden Job Market Playbook with:\n→ [DELIVERABLE]\n→ [DELIVERABLE]\n→ [DELIVERABLE]\n\nDownload it here: [LINK]\n\nOr if you want help building YOUR specific strategy, reply to this email with \"STRATEGY\" and I'll send you details on my [TIMEFRAME] coaching intensive.\n\nStop applying into the void. Start getting interviews.\n\n[YOUR_NAME]\n\nP.S. The [NUMBER] clients I worked with last month? [NUMBER] got offers within [TIMEFRAME]. All through networking, not applications. This works.",
