    "awareness": "Customer notices oil change reminder sticker, dashboard light, or receives manufacturer notification about scheduled maintenance.

    "consideration": "Customer evaluates options between dealership service ($89-149), independent shop ($45-75), or quick-lube chain ($35-65). They compare convenience factors like wait time, location proximity within 5 miles, and available appointment slots. Price comparison websites show 68% research online first.",
    "decision": "Decision hinges on three primary factors: immediate availability (42% same-day service requirement), price point within $20 of expectation (31%), and trust in technician expertise (27%). Customers typically decide within 48 hours of awareness trigger, with 61% choosing based on convenience over price.",
    "retention": "Successful retention requires consistent service delivery, competitive pricing within 15% of market average, and relationship building through service history tracking. Shops retaining customers for 3+ visits see 47% higher lifetime value. Digital service records and automated reminders increase retention by 34%.",
    "advocacy": "Customers become advocates after 3-5 positive experiences, particularly when shops catch potential issues early, saving them $500+ in repairs. Word-of-mouth referrals account for 43% of new customers. Online reviews posted within 7 days of service have 3x more impact on local search rankings."

Seeing a lot of confusion in local groups about oil changes, so let's clear this up:\n\n❓ \"Do I really need synthetic oil?\"\n✅ If you have a turbocharged engine, tow/haul regularly, or drive in extreme temps - YES. Otherwise, follow your manual's recommendation.\n\n❓ \"How often should I change it?\"\n✅ Check your owner's manual, NOT the sticker. Most modern cars: 7,500-10,000 miles with synthetic. BUT if you drive mostly short trips (under 10 miles) or in stop-and-go traffic, cut that in HALF.\n\n❓ \"Can I mix synthetic and conventional?\"\n✅ Technically yes, but you lose synthetic's benefits. Stick with one type.\n\n❓ \"What's the difference between brands?\"\n✅ As long as it meets your manufacturer's spec (look for the API certification), you're good. We use [BRAND_NAME] because [REASON].\n\n❓ \"Will skipping one oil change really hurt my engine?\"\n✅ Maybe not immediately, but you're rolling the dice. Sludge builds up FAST after the recommended interval. Seen too many $4,000+ engine repairs from \"just one more month.\"\n\nPro tip: Set a phone reminder for your next service based on DATE, not just mileage. If you don't drive much, oil still degrades over time (6-12 months max).\n\nDrop your oil change questions below - I'll answer every single one! 👇\n\nAnd if you found this helpful, share it with your car-owning friends.

        "template": "⚠️ UNPOPULAR OPINION: Most oil change places are setting you up for failure.\n\nAfter 50,000+ services, here's what I've learned:\n\nThe industry pushes 3,000-mile intervals because it's profitable, not because your car needs it. Your 2020 Honda? The manual says 7,500 miles. That sticker on your windshield? Ignore it.\n\nBut here's what NO ONE tells you:\n\n🔴 If you drive less than 10 miles per trip (most people do), you're in the \"severe service\" category. That cuts your interval in HALF - even with synthetic.\n\n🔴 Oil life monitors are more accurate than mileage stickers, but only if they're properly reset. 40% of quick-lube places forget to reset them.\n\n🔴 The quality of the oil filter matters MORE than the oil brand. A $3 filter will fail before your oil does, sending metal shavings through your engine.\n\n🔴 \"Full synthetic\" isn't regulated. Some brands are synthetic blends marketed as full synthetic. Look for \"API SN-Plus\" or \"ILSAC GF-6\" certification.\n\nAt [YOUR_BUSINESS_NAME], we do things differently:\n\n✅ We follow YOUR manufacturer's specs (we'll show you the page in your manual)\n✅ We use [PREMIUM_FILTER_BRAND] filters rated for extended intervals\n✅ We properly reset your oil life monitor every time\n✅ We keep digital service records you can access anytime for warranty purposes\n✅ We'll never recommend a service your car doesn't need\n\nIs this approach more expensive than the $19.99 loss-leader special? Sometimes. But our customers average 200,000+ miles on their engines because we do it RIGHT.\n\nYour car is probably your second-biggest investment.

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nAfter 15 years as an ASE Master Technician, I've seen hundreds of engine failures.\n\nAnd here's what surprises people:\n\nMost of these engines had REGULAR oil changes.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\n❌ THE #1 ENGINE KILLER: Using the wrong oil specification\n\nYour [VEHICLE_YEAR] [VEHICLE_MAKE] requires oil that meets [MANUFACTURER_SPEC] specification. Not all \"synthetic\" oils meet this standard.\n\nUsing the wrong spec causes:\n• Turbocharger failure ($2,000-4,000 repair)\n• Timing chain stretch (engine rebuild territory)\n• Catalytic converter damage ($1,500-3,000)\n• Voided warranty claims\n\nHere's how to protect yourself:\n\n✅ STEP 1: Check your owner's manual for the exact specification (not just \"5W-30\" - look for API/ILSAC codes)\n\n✅ STEP 2: Verify your service provider uses oil meeting that spec (ask to see the bottle)\n\n✅ STEP 3: Keep detailed service records showing specification compliance (critical for warranty)\n\nAt [YOUR_BUSINESS_NAME], we maintain a database of every vehicle's required specifications. Your [VEHICLE_MAKE]? We use [OIL_BRAND] [SPECIFICATION] - exactly what [MANUFACTURER] requires.\n\nWe'll show you the bottle. We'll show you the manual page. We'll give you documentation for your records.\n\nBecause a $[SERVICE_PRICE] oil change with the RIGHT oil is cheaper than a $4,000 repair with the wrong oil.\n\nWant to verify your last oil change used the correct specification? Forward me your receipt and I'll review it (no charge).\n\nProtecting [CITY_NAME] engines, one service at a time.\n\n[SIGNATURE]\n[YOUR_NAME], ASE Master Technician\n[YOUR_BUSINESS_NAME]\n[PHONE] | [BOOKING_LINK]\n\nP.S. - Your [VEHICLE_MAKE] is due for service around [DUE_DATE] based on our records.
