  "customer_journey": {
    "awareness": "Parents discover need through school communications (42%), word-of-mouth from other parents (31%), online searches for 'after school care near me' (18%), or workplace childcare resource referrals (9%). Initial awareness typically occurs 3-6 weeks before school starts or within 2 weeks of a schedule change.",
    "consideration": "Parents evaluate 3-4 programs on average over 2-3 weeks, prioritizing location (walking distance from school), hours (6pm pickup minimum), homework help quality, staff-to-child ratios (1:10 preferred), and enrichment activities. They read 15-20 online reviews, visit facilities during operating hours, and check state licensing databases.",
    "decision": "Final decision made after facility tour (87% conversion rate post-tour), meeting key staff, reviewing actual curriculum samples, confirming transportation logistics, and verifying space availability. Price becomes secondary to trust and convenience - parents will pay 20-30% premium for peace of mind.",
    "retention": "Average retention is 2.3 years with 68% staying entire elementary period. Key retention drivers include consistent staff (turnover under 25% annually), regular parent communication via apps, flexible scheduling for occasional changes, and sibling discounts of 10-15%. Monthly parent surveys show 84% satisfaction threshold needed.",
    "advocacy": "Satisfied parents generate 3.7 referrals on average, primarily through school Facebook groups, neighborhood apps like Nextdoor, and playground conversations. Peak referral periods are March-May for following school year and September when new families are struggling. Incentivized referrals convert at 47% vs 22% for organic."

Homework is done. He's happy. I'm present.\"\n\nWhat makes the difference:\n✓ Certified teachers helping with homework (30-45 min vs 2-3 hours at home)\n✓ Structured enrichment activities (STEM, arts, sports)\n✓ Social interaction with peers (loneliness is real for solo after-school kids)\n✓ Professional supervision (not a neighbor's teenager)\n✓ Daily updates so YOU feel connected\n\nReal talk from our parents:\n\"Game changer for our family\" - Lisa M.\n\"I can actually focus at work now\" - David K.\n\"My daughter begs to go - that tells me everything\" - Jennifer L.\n\nIf you're drowning in the 3-6pm chaos, you're not alone.
