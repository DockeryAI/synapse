        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nI need to be honest with you about something.\n\nThe yoga industry has been selling you a lie.\n\nFor [NUMBER] years, I've watched studios prioritize aesthetics over actual healing. Instagram poses over nervous system regulation. Perfect alignment over personal transformation.\n\nI'm done with it.\n\nHere's what [NUMBER] years of teaching and [NUMBER] hours of trauma-informed training has taught me:\n\n→ Your flexibility doesn't matter\n→ Your body shape doesn't matter\n→ Your ability to do advanced poses doesn't matter\n\nWhat DOES matter:\n\n✓ Can you regulate your nervous system when stressed?\n✓ Are you sleeping better?\n✓ Is your chronic pain improving?\n✓ Do you feel more present in your life?\n✓ Are you building sustainable self-care habits?\n\nThat's it. That's the practice.\n\nI've seen [NUMBER]-year-olds transform their lives without ever touching their toes.\n\nI've watched students manage PTSD, eliminate migraines, recover from injuries, and find peace in their bodies - not because they achieved perfect poses, but because they showed up consistently for themselves.\n\nThe research backs this up:\n→ [STAT]% reduction in anxiety (Harvard Medical School)\n→ [STAT]% improvement in chronic pain (Annals of Internal Medicine)\n→ [STAT]% better sleep quality (Journal of Clinical Psychology)\n\nNone of these studies measured flexibility.\n\nSo if you've been waiting until you're \"ready\" or \"flexible enough\" or \"fit enough\" - stop.\n\nYou're already ready. Your nervous system doesn't care what you look like.\n\nThis is why I teach. Not to create Instagram content, but to give you tools that actually work.\n\nIf this resonates, I'd love to have you in class. We have [NUMBER] spots in our [MONTH] beginner program: [LINK]\n\nNo pressure. No judgment. Just real practice for real bodies.\n\nYours in authenticity,\n[INSTRUCTOR_NAME]\n\nP.S. - Reply to this email with your biggest wellness culture frustration. I read every response.",
