Here's what most people don't know about the wine you find in big retail:\n\n1. DESIGNED FOR CONSISTENCY, NOT COMPLEXITY\nMass-market wines blend grapes from multiple regions, multiple years. The goal? Taste identical every time. Safe, but boring.\n\nOur approach: Single-vineyard, single-vintage. Every bottle tells you exactly where and when it came from. Some years are spectacular. Some are just good. That's honest winemaking.\n\n2. PROFIT MARGINS DICTATE QUALITY\nThat $12 bottle? $2-3 is actual wine. The rest is packaging, distribution, marketing, retailer markup.\n\nSmall producers: We sell direct. More of your money goes into what's actually in the bottle.\n\n3. SHORTCUTS YOU CAN'T TASTE (Until You Can)\nCommercial additives, mega-purple for color, oak chips instead of barrel aging. All legal. All common. All compromise quality.\n\nWe use: Grapes, yeast, minimal sulfites. That's it.\n\nHERE'S THE THING:\nI'm not saying grocery wine is bad. I'm saying if you've only had grocery wine, you haven't experienced what wine can be.\n\nThe difference between commodity wine and craft wine is like the difference between Wonder Bread and a local bakery's sourdough. Both are bread. Only one is memorable.\n\nThis Saturday, we're doing a side-by-side comparison tasting: commercial vs. craft. Same varietals, similar price points. Come taste the difference yourself.\n\nReservations in comments or call [PHONE]. $25/person, credited toward any purchase.\n\nWho's joining us?

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nAttention: Someone asked me last week why they can't find our wine at [LOCAL GROCERY CHAIN]. Fair question. Here's the honest answer.\n\nInterest: Mass-market wine is designed for consistency and profit margins, not complexity. Here's what happens behind the scenes:\n\n1. BLENDING FOR SAMENESS\nCommercial wines blend grapes from multiple regions and vintages to taste identical every time. Safe, but one-dimensional.\n\nOur approach: Single-vineyard, single-vintage. Every bottle reflects that specific year's weather, soil, decisions. Some vintages are spectacular. Some are just good. That's authentic winemaking.\n\n2. THE $12 BOTTLE BREAKDOWN\n→ $2-3: Actual wine\n→ $3-4: Packaging, shipping, distributor margin\n→ $3-4: Retailer markup\n→ $2-3: Marketing\n\nDirect-to-consumer model: More of your money goes into what's in the bottle.\n\n3. LEGAL SHORTCUTS\nMega-purple for color, oak chips instead of barrels, commercial yeasts, flavor additives—all legal, all common in commercial wine.\n\nOur ingredient list: Grapes, yeast, minimal sulfites. That's it.\n\nDesire: The difference isn't about price—it's about priorities. We choose quality over convenience, craft over consistency, authenticity over availability.\n\nLast month, we hosted a blind tasting: our [PRODUCT] vs. similar commercial wine at the same price point. 87% of participants preferred ours. The difference? You can taste the decisions we make in the vineyard and cellar.\n\nAction: Experience the difference yourself.\n\n🍷 WINE CLUB MEMBERS: Your [MONTH] allocation ships [DATE]. This month includes our [PRODUCT]—the one that converted [X] grocery-wine drinkers last quarter.\n\n🎟️ NOT A MEMBER: Join our \"Craft vs. Commercial\" tasting this Saturday. $25/person, credited toward any purchase. We'll taste side-by-side and you decide if it matters.\n\nReserve your spot: [LINK]\n\nOr visit our tasting room any [DAYS], [HOURS]. First taste is on us.\n\nCheers to choosing craft,\n[WINEMAKER NAME]\n\nP.S. Curious about our winemaking process? Reply with \"PROCESS\" and I'll send you our behind-the-scenes video series.",
