We've seen brands lose major accounts over compliance gaps.\n\n✅ YOUR ACTION PLAN:\n\n1. Request updated compliance documentation from ALL suppliers by [DATE]\n2. Audit your traceability system - can you trace any ingredient lot in under 4 hours?\n3. Review your co-manufacturer's certifications (SQF Level 3, BRC, organic, etc.)\n4. Schedule a mock audit BEFORE your official audit\n5. Document everything in a centralized system\n\n💡 PRO TIP: The brands that sleep well at night have quarterly compliance reviews, not annual scrambles.\n\nWe're hosting a FREE webinar on [DATE] covering:\n→ Line-by-line regulation breakdown\n→ Documentation templates you can use immediately\n→ Common audit failures and how to avoid them\n→ Q&A with our compliance team\n\nRegister here: [LINK]\n\nDrop a 🙋 if you're attending or tag someone who needs to see this.\n\nWhat's your biggest compliance headache?
