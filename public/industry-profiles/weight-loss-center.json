Contraindication screening\nPatients with personal/family history of thyroid cancer, pancreatitis, or gastroparesis need alternative approaches. Telehealth questionnaires miss nuances.\n\n2. Dosing optimization\nStarting doses, titration schedules, and combining medications require clinical expertise. Cookie-cutter protocols increase side effects and discontinuation.\n\n3. Nutritional deficiencies\nGLP-1s reduce appetite dramatically. Without monitoring, patients develop protein deficiency, muscle loss, and micronutrient depletion.\n\n4. Maintenance planning\nWhat happens after goal weight? Medication-only approaches see 70% regain without behavioral integration.\n\nOur protocol: comprehensive metabolic panel, body composition analysis, medication management, nutritional counseling, and transition planning.\n\nResult: [X]% medication continuation rate vs. [X]% industry average.\n\nThe medication is a tool, not a solution.

We also use metabolic testing, nutritional counseling, behavior modification, and other FDA-approved medications based on YOUR specific needs. Some patients don't need medication at all—they need thyroid treatment or sleep apnea management.\n\n❌ MYTH: \"I'll just gain it all back when I stop\"\n✅ FACT: Our maintenance protocol transitions you gradually with continued support. [X]% of patients maintain 80%+ of loss at 2 years because we address the ROOT CAUSES, not just symptoms. You learn sustainable habits while medically supported.\n\n❌ MYTH: \"Insurance won't cover it\"\n✅ FACT: Most insurance plans cover medical weight loss visits and many cover medications, especially if you have diabetes, hypertension, or sleep apnea. We have a dedicated insurance specialist who handles prior authorizations. Out-of-pocket costs are often less than people spend on failed diet programs.\n\n❌ MYTH: \"It's dangerous—I heard about side effects\"\n✅ FACT: All medications have potential side effects, which is exactly WHY medical supervision matters. We start low, go slow, monitor labs, and adjust. Compare that to unmonitored online prescriptions or the very real dangers of obesity: heart disease, stroke, diabetes complications.\n\n❌ MYTH: \"I should be able to do this on my own\"\n✅ FACT: Would you tell a diabetic they should manage blood sugar through willpower alone? Obesity is a medical condition with genetic, hormonal, and metabolic components. Treating it medically isn't weakness—it's smart healthcare.\n\nReal talk from [PATIENT NAME]:\n\"I wasted 10 years and thousands of dollars on programs that blamed ME when they didn't work. Medical weight loss finally treated my body's actual problems. Lost [X] lbs, off [X] medications, and I'm not white-knuckling through life anymore.\"\n\nQuestions about medical weight loss?

But because:\n\n1️⃣ They get about 4 hours of nutrition education in medical school\n2️⃣ They have 15 minutes per appointment to address multiple issues\n3️⃣ They're not trained in obesity medicine specifically\n4️⃣ They don't have time for the weekly accountability that actually works\n\nThink about it: Would you see a general practitioner for complex heart surgery? No—you'd see a cardiac surgeon.\n\nWeight loss, especially if you have 50+ pounds to lose or obesity-related conditions, needs specialized care.\n\nWhat medical weight loss specialists do differently:\n\n✓ Comprehensive metabolic testing (not just BMI and basic labs)\n→ We measure resting metabolic rate, insulin resistance, hormone levels, body composition\n\n✓ Medication expertise\n→ We know which FDA-approved medications work for which patients, proper dosing, combination therapy, managing side effects\n\n✓ Treating underlying causes\n→ PCOS, thyroid disorders, sleep apnea, insulin resistance—these sabotage weight loss and need medical treatment\n\n✓ Weekly accountability and adjustment\n→ Your body changes as you lose weight. We adjust the plan in real-time.\n\n✓ Insurance navigation\n→ We know how to code visits and get medications covered\n\nThe results speak for themselves:\n\n📊 Our patients lose an average of [X] lbs in [X] months\n📊 [X]% reduce or eliminate diabetes medications\n📊 [X]% are still maintaining loss at 18 months\n📊 [X]% program completion rate vs. 12% for commercial diet programs\n\nPatient perspective from [NAME]:\n\n\"My doctor told me for 5 years to lose weight. I tried everything. Finally she referred me to [CENTER NAME]. Within 3 months my A1C went from 7.2 to 5.8. I'm off metformin. Down [X] lbs. The difference?
