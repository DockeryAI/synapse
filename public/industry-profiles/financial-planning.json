It was brilliant for its time. But it assumed:\n• 30-year retirement (people live longer now)\n• 50/50 stock/bond allocation (doesn't fit everyone)\n• Fixed spending (your spending changes through retirement)\n• No Social Security optimization\n• No tax planning\n\nNew research from Morningstar, Vanguard, and Michael Kitces shows the 4% rule is either too conservative (leaving money on the table) or too aggressive (depending on when you retire).\n\nWhat we use instead: DYNAMIC WITHDRAWAL STRATEGY\n\nYears 1-10 (Go-Go Years): [PERCENTAGE]% - You're active, traveling, spending more\nYears 11-20 (Slow-Go Years): [PERCENTAGE]% - Spending naturally decreases  \nYears 21+ (No-Go Years): [PERCENTAGE]% - Healthcare increases but discretionary drops\n\nADJUSTED for:\n✓ Market performance (guardrails: cut spending [PERCENTAGE]% if portfolio drops [PERCENTAGE]%)\n✓ Tax bracket management (Roth conversions in low-income years)\n✓ Social Security timing (delay to 70 if portfolio supports it)\n✓ Required Minimum Distributions planning\n✓ Healthcare costs before Medicare\n\nReal example:\nClient A (retired 2022 at peak): 3.2% initial withdrawal, increasing to 4.5% later\nClient B (retired 2020 pre-bull run): 4.8% initial withdrawal, decreasing to 3.5% later\n\nSame portfolio size. Different strategies. Both have 95%+ probability of success through age 95.\n\nThe 4% rule gives you A number. Dynamic planning gives you THE RIGHT number for YOUR situation.\n\nThis is why DIY retirement planning is risky. One-size-fits-all rules don't account for:\n• Your specific retirement date (sequence of returns risk)\n• Your tax situation  \n• Your spending personality\n• Your longevity expectations\n• Your legacy goals\n\nRetirement income planning is the most important financial decision you'll make.

        "preview_text": "Don't roll over that old 401(k) until you read this (could cost you $[AMOUNT])",
        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nChanged jobs recently? About to?\n\nYour HR department will tell you to \"roll your old 401(k) to an IRA.\" Seems simple.\n\nBut that advice just cost my client [NAME] the ability to do backdoor Roth conversions for the next [NUMBER] years. That's $[AMOUNT] in lost tax-free growth.\n\nHere's what most people don't know:\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\nRolling a traditional 401(k) to a traditional IRA triggers the \"pro-rata rule\" which makes backdoor Roth conversions impossible (or extremely tax-inefficient).\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\nIf you earn over $[INCOME] (single) or $[INCOME] (married), you can't contribute directly to a Roth IRA. The backdoor Roth is your only option. But it only works if you have NO money in traditional IRAs.\n\nTHE 5-QUESTION DECISION TREE:\n\nBefore you roll over ANY 401(k), ask:\n\n1. Does your old 401(k) have institutional funds with lower fees than retail IRAs? (Many do)\n\n2. Are you over 55 and might need penalty-free access? (Rule of 55 only works in 401k, not IRA)\n\n3. Do you earn over the Roth IRA limits and want to do backdoor conversions? (IRA rollover kills this)\n\n4. Do you live in a state where 401(k)s have stronger creditor protection than IRAs? ([NUMBER] states)\n\n5. Does your new employer's 401(k) accept rollovers AND have good investment options? (Often the best move)\n\nREAL EXAMPLE:\n[CLIENT_NAME], age [AGE], income $[AMOUNT], changed jobs with $[AMOUNT] in old 401(k).\n\nAlmost rolled to IRA. We analyzed:\n• Old 401(k) expense ratios: [PERCENTAGE]%\n• IRA options would be: [PERCENTAGE]%  \n• Wants to do backdoor Roth: YES\n• New employer accepts rollovers: YES\n\nDecision: Rolled old 401(k) to NEW employer's 401(k). Kept IRA empty. Can now do $[AMOUNT]/year backdoor Roth conversions. Over [NUMBER] years = $[AMOUNT] in tax-free growth.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\n401(k) rollovers are NOT one-size-fits-all. The right answer depends on your specific situation.\n\nNEXT STEPS:\nIf you have an old 401(k) and aren't sure what to do, reply to this email with:\n• Current age\n• Old 401(k) balance  \n• Household income\n• Whether you want to do backdoor Roth conversions\n\nI'll send you the specific analysis for your situation (no cost, no obligation).\n\nOr if you want the full decision framework, I've created a [NUMBER]-page guide. Reply \"ROLLOVER GUIDE\" and I'll send it over.\n\nYour future self will thank you for getting this right.\n\n[YOUR_NAME], CFP®\n[FIRM_NAME]\nP: [PHONE] | E: [EMAIL]\n\nP.S.

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nControversial statement: Maxing out your 401(k) isn't always the smartest move.\n\n(I can hear the personal finance Reddit mob already)\n\nBut hear me out. The math changes at higher income levels.\n\nTHE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM:\n\"Always max your 401(k)! It's tax-advantaged! Free money!\"\n\nTHE REALITY:\nFor high-earners, blindly maxing traditional 401(k) contributions can actually COST you money in lifetime taxes.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIf you're in the [PERCENTAGE]% tax bracket NOW and expect to be in the [PERCENTAGE]% bracket in retirement (or higher), you're:\n• Getting a [PERCENTAGE]% tax deduction today\n• Paying [PERCENTAGE]%+ on withdrawals later\n• Losing money on the tax arbitrage\n\nPlus:\n• All growth is taxed as ordinary income (not capital gains)\n• Required Minimum Distributions might push you into higher brackets\n• Social Security taxation increases with IRA distributions\n• Medicare surcharges kick in (IRMAA)\n\nA BETTER APPROACH FOR EARNERS OVER $[INCOME]:\n\n✓ Contribute enough for full employer match (that's actually free money)\n✓ Max Roth 401(k) if available (tax-free growth)\n✓ Max backdoor Roth IRA ($[AMOUNT]/year)\n✓ Consider taxable brokerage for amounts above that\n\nWhy taxable brokerage?\n• Long-term capital gains taxed at [PERCENTAGE]% (vs [PERCENTAGE]% ordinary income)\n• No Required Minimum Distributions\n• Access anytime without penalties\n• Step-up in basis for heirs\n• Tax-loss harvesting opportunities\n\nREAL CLIENT EXAMPLE:\n[CLIENT_NAME], age [AGE], income $[AMOUNT]/year\n\nOld strategy (what they were doing):\n• Maxing traditional 401(k): $[AMOUNT]/year\n• Tax deduction: $[AMOUNT] (at [PERCENTAGE]% bracket)\n\nNew strategy (what we implemented):\n• Employer match only: $[AMOUNT]\n• Roth 401(k): $[AMOUNT]  \n• Backdoor Roth IRA: $[AMOUNT]\n• Taxable brokerage: $[AMOUNT]\n\nResult over 20 years:\n• Tax savings in retirement: $[AMOUNT]\n• More flexibility for early retirement\n• Lower Medicare premiums\n• Better estate planning for heirs\n\nTHE NUANCE:\nThis doesn't apply to everyone. Traditional 401(k) max-out still makes sense if:\n• You're in high bracket now, expect lower in retirement\n• You're not a high-earner (under $[INCOME])\n• You want to retire early and do Roth conversion ladder\n• You have pension income reducing retirement tax brackets\n\nTHIS IS WHY PERSONALIZED PLANNING MATTERS:\nOne-size-fits-all advice (even \"good\" advice like max your 401k) breaks down at the individual level.\n\nYour optimal strategy depends on:\n• Current and projected income\n• State tax situation (now and retirement)\n• Other retirement income sources\n• Retirement timeline\n• Estate planning goals\n• Risk tolerance and liquidity needs\n\nWANT TO SEE YOUR OPTIMAL STRATEGY?\n\nI'm running a [NUMBER]-year tax projection analysis for [NUMBER] people this month showing:\n• Traditional 401(k) max vs strategic allocation\n• Lifetime tax comparison\n• Retirement income scenarios\n• Specific recommendations for your situation\n\nNo cost.
