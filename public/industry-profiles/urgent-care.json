        "body": "Hi [FIRSTNAME],\n\nIt's 8 PM on a Tuesday. You've been feeling terrible all day, and it's getting worse. Your doctor's office is closed. Now you're stuck wondering:\n\n\"Do I need the ER, or can urgent care handle this?\"\n\nLet me make this simple:\n\n❌ GO TO THE ER IF YOU HAVE:\n• Chest pain or pressure\n• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath  \n• Severe bleeding that won't stop\n• Sudden severe headache or vision changes\n• Signs of stroke (face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty)\n• Severe allergic reaction\n• Major trauma or head injury\n\n✅ COME TO URGENT CARE FOR:\n• Flu, fever, cold symptoms\n• Sprains, strains, minor fractures\n• Cuts that need stitches (but not severe bleeding)\n• Ear infections, sinus infections, UTIs\n• Rashes, allergic reactions (non-severe)\n• Vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration\n• Minor burns\n• COVID/flu/strep testing\n• School and sports physicals\n• Work injuries\n\n💰 THE COST DIFFERENCE:\nER visit for strep throat: $2,000-$3,500\nUrgent care for same treatment: $100-$200\n\n⏰ WE'RE HERE WHEN YOU NEED US:\nMonday-Sunday: 8 AM-10 PM\nNo appointment necessary\nOnline check-in available\n\n📱 SAVE YOUR SPOT:\n[ONLINE CHECK-IN LINK]\n\nQuestions?

        "body": "Hi [FIRSTNAME],\n\nDr. [NAME] here, Medical Director at [FACILITY NAME].\n\nAfter [NUMBER] years in urgent care medicine, I keep seeing the same misconceptions. So I wanted to set the record straight:\n\n1️⃣ YOU'RE NOT BOTHERING US\nSeriously. If you're worried enough to google your symptoms at midnight, you should come in. That's what we're here for. I'd rather see you for something minor than have you wait until it becomes serious.\n\n2️⃣ WE'RE NOT A \"LESSER\" OPTION\nWe have the same diagnostic tools as most ERs: X-rays, lab work, EKGs. Our providers are board-certified physicians and experienced nurse practitioners. The only difference? We don't handle life-threatening emergencies. Everything else? We've got you.\n\n3️⃣ WEEKEND CARE ISN'T JUST FOR EMERGENCIES  \nYou don't have to be dying to come in on Saturday. Got a UTI? Sprained ankle? Flu symptoms? That's exactly why we're open weekends—so you don't have to suffer until Monday.\n\n4️⃣ YOUR INSURANCE PROBABLY COVERS US\nMost insurance plans cover urgent care the same as a specialist visit. Your copay is usually $50-$75 vs. $2,000+ at the ER. Call your insurance and ask about your \"urgent care copay.\"\n\n5️⃣ ONLINE CHECK-IN IS A GAME-CHANGER\nYou can save your spot from your phone, then wait at home or in your car. We text you when it's your turn. No sitting in a waiting room when you feel terrible.\n\n🎯 WHEN TO USE US:\n→ Your doctor can't see you for 2+ weeks\n→ You get sick outside business hours  \n→ You need immediate care but it's not life-threatening\n→ You want to avoid ER wait times and costs\n\n📍 [LOCATION]\n⏰ Open 8 AM-10 PM, 7 days a week\n💻 Save your spot: [LINK]\n\nQuestions about whether we can treat your specific condition? Just reply to this email.\n\n- Dr. [NAME]\n\nP.S. We're accepting new patients and take most insurance. Bring this email for $10 off your visit this month.",
