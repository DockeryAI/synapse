Let me share what our most successful customers do:\n\nGrab 4 boxes/areas and label them:\n📦 KEEP (but finding a proper home for it)\n📦 DONATE (still useful, just not to you)\n📦 SELL (worth the effort of listing)\n📦 JUNK (broken, unusable, or just done)\n\nThe rule: Touch each item ONCE. No \"maybe\" pile. That's where stuff goes to live forever.\n\nPro tip from 12 years of cleanouts: If you haven't used it in 2 years and it doesn't have serious sentimental value, it goes in DONATE or JUNK. I know that's harsh, but I've seen people keep broken [item] \"just in case\" for a decade.\n\nFor the JUNK pile—that's where we come in. We'll haul it, recycle what we can, and dispose of the rest responsibly. You don't need a truck or a strong back.\n\nThis Saturday, set a timer for 2 hours. Just 2 hours. See how much you can categorize. Then call us Monday for the junk pile. \n\nWho's actually doing this with me this weekend?

It's about:\n→ Who was the favorite child\n→ Who sacrificed more for mom\n→ Who feels guilty for not visiting enough\n→ Who needs something tangible to hold onto\n\nThe families that handle estate cleanouts well do this:\n\n1. They hire a neutral third party (like us) to document EVERYTHING with photos before anything moves\n2. They set a specific timeline (\"we have 2 weeks to decide, then it gets donated\")\n3. They acknowledge that keeping everything isn't honoring mom—it's avoiding grief\n4. They take photos of sentimental items they can't keep (the memory stays, the clutter doesn't)\n\nI'm not a therapist, but I've sat with enough grieving families to know: the kindest thing you can do is make decisions and move forward together.\n\nIf you're facing this right now, please know:\n→ It's okay to hire help\n→ It's okay to not keep everything\n→ It's okay to feel relief when it's done\n→ Your love for them isn't measured in boxes kept\n\nWe offer free consultations for estate situations because I know how overwhelming this is.

The memory lives in your heart, not in boxes.\n\n**HERE'S WHAT WE DO DIFFERENTLY:**\n\n→ Free family mediation consultation (I'm not a therapist, but I've been through this 847 times)\n→ Complete photo documentation before we touch anything\n→ Separate \"decision items\" from obvious junk\n→ Coordinate with estate attorneys and family members in different states\n→ Handle donation receipts for estate tax purposes\n\n**LAST MONTH:** We helped the [Last Name] family clear their mom's home of 40 years. Four adult children, three states, zero arguments.\n\nHow? We followed the framework above. It took 6 days instead of 6 months.\n\n**IF YOU'RE FACING THIS RIGHT NOW:**\n\nI want you to know:\n→ It's okay to hire help\n→ It's okay to not keep everything\n→ It's okay to feel relief when it's done\n→ Your love isn't measured in boxes kept\n\nReply to this email or call [PHONE] for a free consultation.
