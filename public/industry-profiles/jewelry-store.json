Result? A ring that costs more but impresses less.\n\nSolution: The Priority Framework we teach clients:\n1. Cut quality (affects sparkle): Allocate 40% of budget\n2.

Clarity (rarely visible): 10%\n\nExample: [CUSTOMER NAME] redirected $2,000 from VS1 to VS2 clarity (identical to naked eye) and upgraded from 0.9 to 1.1 carat.

Trace the inside on paper and bring it to us. Accuracy rate: 85%\n\n✅ THE FRIEND MISSION: Her best friend or sister can casually suggest trying on rings while shopping together. They text you a photo of the size. Accuracy rate: 95%\n\n✅ THE EDUCATED GUESS: Average ring size is 6-7. If she has small hands/fingers, go with 5.5-6. Larger hands? 7-7.5. We can resize within 48 hours after the proposal. Accuracy rate: 70%\n\n❌ AVOID: The \"borrow her ring while she's sleeping\" move. Too risky—she'll notice it's missing and get suspicious!\n\n💡 PRO TIP: When in doubt, size slightly larger. Rings are easier to size down than up, and you can use a temporary sizer for the proposal moment.\n\nREAL STORY: [CUSTOMER NAME] used the friend method. His now-fiancée had NO idea, and the ring fit perfectly during the proposal. She still talks about how impressed she was that he got every detail right.\n\nAnd here's what most people don't know: We offer FREE resizing for life on all engagement rings. So even if you're off by a size or two, we'll make it perfect within days of the proposal at no cost.\n\nQuestions?

That \"rule\" was literally created by a diamond company's marketing campaign in the 1930s.\n\nHere's what actually matters:\n\n💎 WHAT THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY WON'T TELL YOU:\n\nThe \"3-month rule\" was invented by De Beers in 1930s advertising. It's marketing, not tradition. Not wisdom. Just marketing that stuck.\n\nYour ring budget should be based on:\n✓ What you can comfortably afford without debt stress\n✓ What aligns with your shared financial goals\n✓ What feels meaningful to BOTH of you\n\nI've seen $2,000 rings bring tears of joy and $20,000 rings create financial anxiety that shadowed the engagement. Guess which couple was happier?\n\n💡 REAL TALK FROM REAL COUPLES:\n\n\"We decided together that a smaller diamond now and a house down payment later mattered more than a bigger ring. Best decision we made.\" - [CUSTOMER NAME]\n\n\"I made more than he did, so we split the cost 60/40. The ring represents US, not outdated gender roles.\" - [CUSTOMER NAME]\n\n\"We bought a lab-grown diamond—same sparkle, 40% less cost, ethically sourced. It's perfect for our values.\" - [CUSTOMER NAME]\n\n🎯 MY ADVICE AFTER [NUMBER] PROPOSALS:\n\n1. Have an honest conversation about budget (romance isn't ruined by financial responsibility)\n2. Prioritize what matters to YOU—size, quality, ethical sourcing, or design uniqueness\n3. Remember: this ring symbolizes your commitment, not your net worth\n\nThe jewelry industry has a trust problem because we've pushed expensive over meaningful for too long. I'm here to change that.\n\nYour engagement should start with joy, not debt.\n\nWhat do you wish someone had told you before buying an engagement ring?

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nProblem: You're ready to propose, but you have no idea what ring size she is. Asking ruins the surprise. Guessing wrong ruins the moment.\n\nI've seen this panic in [NUMBER] nervous proposers. The good news? There are ways to find out without spoiling anything.\n\nAgitation: Imagine this—you're on one knee, she's crying happy tears, you open the box... and the ring doesn't fit. It slides around. Or worse, doesn't go past her knuckle. That moment of magic? Interrupted by awkward sizing talk.\n\nSolution: Here are the 3 methods that actually work:\n\n✅ THE FRIEND MISSION (95% accuracy)\nHer best friend or sister takes her \"shopping\" and casually tries on rings. They text you a photo of the size tag. She never suspects.\n\n✅ THE TRACE METHOD (85% accuracy)\nBorrow a ring she wears on her ring finger (right hand works too). Trace the inside circle on paper. Bring it to us. We'll match it exactly.\n\n✅ THE EDUCATED GUESS (70% accuracy)\nAverage size is 6-7. Small hands? Go 5.5-6. Larger? Try 7-7.5. We offer free resizing within 48 hours of your proposal, so being close is good enough.\n\n💡 Pro tip: When in doubt, size slightly LARGER. Rings are easier to size down, and you can use a temporary adjuster for the proposal itself.\n\nReal story: [CUSTOMER_NAME] used the friend method for his Valentine's Day proposal. The ring fit perfectly. His fiancée still talks about how he got every detail right—including the size.\n\nRemember: We offer lifetime free resizing on all engagement rings. Even if you're off by a size, we'll fix it within days at no cost.\n\nReady to start planning? Reply to this email or call [PHONE] to schedule your private consultation.\n\nYour proposal is going to be perfect,\n\n[YOUR_NAME]\n[STORE_NAME]\n\nP.S. — Download our complete Proposal Planning Guide here: [LINK].

        "body": "Hi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nAttention: The \"3-month salary\" rule for engagement rings? It was invented by a diamond company's marketing department in 1938. It's not tradition. It's advertising.\n\nAfter [NUMBER] years and [NUMBER] successful proposals, I need to share what actually creates happy couples:\n\nInterest: Your ring budget should be based on:\n✓ What you can afford without financial stress\n✓ What aligns with your shared values and goals\n✓ What feels meaningful to both of you—not what marketing says\n\nI've watched $2,500 rings bring tears of joy and $25,000 rings create anxiety that shadowed the entire engagement. The difference? One couple spent within their comfort zone. The other followed an arbitrary \"rule.\"\n\nDesire: Here's what our happiest couples did differently:\n\n[CUSTOMER_NAME]: \"We talked openly about budget. I wanted a beautiful ring, but I wanted a house down payment more. We got both by choosing smart over big.\"\n\n[CUSTOMER_NAME]: \"We bought a lab-grown diamond—same sparkle, 40% less cost, ethically sourced. It perfectly represents our values.\"\n\n[CUSTOMER_NAME]: \"I make more than he does, so we split the cost. The ring represents our partnership, not outdated rules.\"\n\nAction: This week only, book a no-pressure consultation where we'll:\n✅ Help you set a realistic budget (based on YOUR situation)\n✅ Show you how to maximize impact at any price point\n✅ Explain where to invest and where to save\n✅ Create a ring you'll both love without financial stress\n\nYour engagement should start with joy, not debt.\n\n👉 Schedule your consultation: [BOOKING_LINK]\n👉 Or call [PHONE] and mention this email\n\nLimited to [NUMBER] consultations this week—we take time to do this right.\n\nHere to help you start your marriage on solid ground,\n\n[YOUR_NAME]\n[STORE_NAME]\n\nP.S. — Forward this to a friend who's ring shopping.
