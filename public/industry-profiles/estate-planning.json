Read this now...\n\n[FIRST NAME],\n\nThe estate tax exemption drops from $13.6M to $7M per person in 2026.\n\nIf your net worth exceeds $7M (or $14M married), you're about to face a 40% tax on everything above that.\n\nThat's $[AMOUNT]M+ your family won't inherit unless you act before [DEADLINE].\n\nI've spent the last [TIMEFRAME] analyzing this for [NUMBER] high-net-worth clients. Three strategies are working:\n\n**STRATEGY 1: Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs)**\nMove assets out of your estate while maintaining indirect access through your spouse. One client just protected $[AMOUNT]M using this approach.\n\n**STRATEGY 2: Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)**  \nTransfer appreciating assets to heirs while minimizing gift tax. Perfect for business owners expecting growth.\n\n**STRATEGY 3: Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILITs)**\nRemove life insurance from your taxable estate. A $[AMOUNT]M policy outside your estate saves $[AMOUNT]M in taxes.\n\nThe families taking action now are saving 7 figures in future taxes.\n\nThe families waiting? They're gambling that Congress extends the exemption (unlikely).\n\n**Here's what I recommend:**\n\nIf your net worth is $7M-15M: Focus on SLATs and strategic gifting\nIf your net worth is $15M-50M: Combine SLATs with GRATs  \nIf your net worth is $50M+: Comprehensive strategy using all three + dynasty trusts\n\nThe window closes [DEADLINE]. After that, your options are limited.\n\nI'm offering [NUMBER] complimentary strategy sessions this month for families with $[AMOUNT]M+ net worth.\n\nWe'll review your situation and create a tax-optimization roadmap.
