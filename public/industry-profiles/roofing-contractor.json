If your roof fails, you have 90 days to replace or they drop you.\n\n[INSURANCE_COMPANY_3] - No longer covering \"cosmetic\" storm damage. Only structural damage qualifies.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n\nWe're getting 3-4 calls per day from panicked homeowners who got non-renewal letters. The problem? Every roofing company is now booked 6-8 weeks out.\n\nIf you wait until you GET the letter, you might not be able to get it done before your deadline.\n\nWHAT TO DO:\n\n1. Check your roof age (it's on your home inspection report or ask your insurance agent)\n2. If it's 12+ years old, get an inspection NOW before you get the letter\n3. If you've had storm damage in the last 2 years, file a claim ASAP (new policies are stricter)\n4. Get your inspection report in writing—you'll need it for insurance\n\nWE'RE HELPING [CITY] HOMEOWNERS BY:\n\n✓ Free inspections with written reports (yours to keep)\n✓ Direct communication with insurance adjusters\n✓ Priority scheduling for insurance deadline cases\n✓ Financing options if insurance doesn't cover it all\n\nWe've helped [NUMBER] homeowners navigate this in the last [TIMEFRAME], with an average insurance approval of $[AMOUNT].\n\nReal example: [CLIENT_NAME] on [STREET] got a non-renewal notice on March 15th with a May 1st deadline.

        "body": "SUBJECT: 🚨 Insurance alert: [CITY] homeowners with 15+ year roofs\nPREVIEW: Non-renewal notices going out next month. Here's your action plan...\n\n---\n\nHi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nATTENTION:\nIn [NUMBER] years of roofing, I've never seen insurance companies move this fast. [INSURANCE_COMPANY_1], [INSURANCE_COMPANY_2], and [INSURANCE_COMPANY_3] are now requiring roof replacements on homes with roofs 15+ years old.\n\nNon-renewal notices start going out [MONTH].\n\nINTEREST:\nHere's what's happening:\n\n• [INSURANCE_COMPANY_1]: Roof inspection required for renewal. Fail = 90 days to replace or lose coverage\n• [INSURANCE_COMPANY_2]: Automatic non-renewal for roofs 15+ years\n• [INSURANCE_COMPANY_3]: No longer covering \"cosmetic\" storm damage\n\nWe're getting 3-4 panic calls per day from homeowners who got letters. The problem? Every roofing company is now booked 6-8 weeks out.\n\nDESIRE:\nWe're helping [CITY] homeowners by:\n\n✓ Priority inspections for insurance deadline cases\n✓ Direct adjuster communication (we handle the paperwork)\n✓ Storm damage assessment (you might have coverage you don't know about)\n✓ Written reports that satisfy carrier requirements\n\nReal example: [CLIENT_NAME] got a non-renewal notice March 15 with May 1 deadline. We inspected March 18, filed claim March 20, insurance approved $18,500 April 2, completed roof April 28. She kept her insurance.\n\nACTION:\nCheck your roof age (it's on your home inspection report). If it's 12+ years old, get inspected NOW before you get the letter.\n\n[BUTTON: Schedule Priority Inspection]\n\nWe have [NUMBER] inspection slots available this week.\n\nWhat we'll do:\n1. Free inspection with written report (yours to keep)\n2. Check for insurance-claimable damage from past storms\n3. Provide timeline and options\n4. Handle all insurance communication if needed\n\nAverage insurance approval: $[AMOUNT]\nAverage out-of-pocket after insurance: $[AMOUNT]\n\n[BUTTON: Check My Roof Age]\n\nQuestions? Just reply to this email.\n\n[SIGNATURE]\n[NAME]\n[COMPANY]\n[PHONE] | [WEBSITE]\n\nP.S. - Forward this to neighbors who might need it. This affects most homeowners in [CITY].",
