Insurance covers the rebuild, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nToday's building codes require:\n• Updated electrical (not in your policy)\n• New plumbing standards (not covered)\n• Energy efficiency requirements (excluded)\n• Accessibility features (your problem)\n\nTotal additional cost?

It costs about $30-50/year extra and covers up to 25% of your dwelling amount for code compliance.\n\nOn a $300,000 home, that's $75,000 in code upgrade coverage for less than $4/month.\n\nWant to check if you have this coverage?\n\n1.

It's about which matches your actual needs.\n\nYOU PROBABLY NEED TERM IF:\n✓ You have young kids and a mortgage\n✓ Your family relies on your income\n✓ You need maximum coverage for minimum cost\n✓ Your need for insurance has an end date (kids grown, mortgage paid)\n\nYOU MIGHT NEED WHOLE LIFE IF:\n✓ You've maxed out retirement accounts\n✓ You have estate tax concerns (estates over $13M)\n✓ You want guaranteed cash value growth\n✓ You need permanent coverage for estate planning\n\nWhat I see constantly: Young families with $50,000 whole life policies paying $200/month when they could have $500,000 term coverage for $45/month.\n\nOr high-net-worth individuals with only term coverage when they'll need permanent insurance for estate liquidity.\n\nThe insurance you need at 30 isn't the insurance you need at 50.\n\nHere's my honest recommendation:\n\n1. Calculate how much coverage you actually need (not what you can afford)\n2. Determine how long you need it\n3. Then pick the product that delivers that protection most efficiently\n\nMost people do it backwards: They look at what they can afford monthly, then buy whatever product fits that budget.\n\nThat's how you end up underinsured or overpaying.\n\nQuestions about your specific situation?
