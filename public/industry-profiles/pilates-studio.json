Because stretching tight muscles doesn't fix weak ones.\n\nYour shoulders are up by your ears because your mid-back is weak, not because your chest is tight. Stretching alone won't fix this.\n\nWhat actually works:\n\n1️⃣ STRENGTHEN the muscles that pull you into good posture\n2️⃣ STRETCH the muscles that pull you out of it\n3️⃣ RETRAIN the movement patterns you do 1,000 times a day\n\nI created a free guide with 5 exercises you can do at your desk (no equipment needed) that address all three.\n\nThese aren't random stretches. They're the exact sequence I teach corporate clients who sit 8+ hours daily.\n\nWhat you'll get:\n✅ Photo demonstrations for each exercise\n✅ Why each one works (the actual anatomy)\n✅ How often to do them for real results\n✅ Modifications if you have shoulder/back pain\n✅ A 5-minute routine you can set a calendar reminder for\n\nComment \"POSTURE\" below and I'll send you the PDF directly. 💪\n\nOr share this with your work-from-home friends who are constantly complaining about their neck and shoulders!\n\nP.S. - If you've tried everything and nothing sticks, you might need more than stretches.

        "body": "Subject: The real reason your back pain keeps coming back\nPreview: Hint: It's not what your chiropractor thinks\n\n---\n\nHi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nYou've tried everything for your back pain:\n\n✓ Chiropractor (feels better for a few days)\n✓ Massage (relaxing but temporary)\n✓ Ibuprofen (masking, not fixing)\n✓ YouTube stretches (confusing and inconsistent)\n\nBut it keeps coming back. Usually right when you're picking up [your kids/groceries/something heavy].\n\nHere's why:\n\nYou're treating the symptom, not the cause.\n\nYour back hurts because your CORE is weak. Not your abs (though those might be weak too). Your deep stabilizing muscles that should be supporting your spine 24/7.\n\nThink of it like this:\nYour spine is a tent pole. Your core muscles are the support wires. When the wires are loose, the pole wobbles and eventually breaks.\n\nChiropractors adjust the pole. Massage relaxes the pole. Pain meds numb the pole.\n\nBut none of them tighten the support wires.\n\nThat's what Pilates does.\n\nWe teach your deep core muscles to actually do their job - support your spine during every movement, every day.\n\nNot just during your workout. During your LIFE.\n\n[CLIENT NAME] had chronic lower back pain for 3 years. Tried everything you've tried. After 8 weeks of Pilates, she's pain-free and just went on a hiking trip she'd been putting off.\n\nThe difference? We fixed the cause, not just the symptom.\n\n---\n\nWant to see if this approach works for YOUR back pain?\n\nFirst class is free. No commitment, no pressure.\n\nJust come experience what it feels like when someone actually teaches you how to move in a way that supports your spine.\n\n[BOOK YOUR FREE CLASS]\n\nTo your pain-free life,\n[INSTRUCTOR NAME]\n[STUDIO NAME]\n\nP.S. - Bring your questions. Bring your skepticism. Bring your back pain. We'll address all three.",

She showed up anyway.\n\nThe guy who hadn't worked out in 15 years? He showed up anyway.\n\nThe mom who was embarrassed about her post-baby body?

Not before.\n\nI'm telling you this because I know you're waiting for something.\n\nThe right time. The right motivation. The right body. The right mindset.\n\nBut here's what [NUMBER] years has taught me:\n\nThe right time is when you decide to start.\nThe right body is the one you have right now.\nThe right mindset comes from taking action, not from waiting.\n\n---\n\nWe have [NUMBER] spots opening in our [MONTH] beginner series.\n\nSmall classes.
