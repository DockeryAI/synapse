Most people miss this common deduction.\n\nIf you worked from home AT ALL in [YEAR], even part-time, you might qualify for home office deduction. Here's what most people don't know:\n\n📍 THE PROBLEM:\nYou're paying full taxes without claiming legitimate workspace expenses. Even if you're employed full-time but have a dedicated workspace for side income, you could be missing out.\n\n😰 WHY IT HURTS:\nThe average home office deduction saves $[AMOUNT]-$[AMOUNT] annually. Multiply that by years you haven't claimed it = serious money left on the table.\n\n✅ THE SOLUTION:\nYou can deduct:\n→ Portion of rent/mortgage (based on square footage)\n→ Utilities (electric, internet, phone)\n→ Repairs and maintenance\n→ Depreciation (if you own)\n\nQUICK QUALIFICATION CHECK:\n✓ Do you have a dedicated workspace? (doesn't have to be a full room)\n✓ Is it used regularly and exclusively for business?\n✓ Do you have self-employment or 1099 income?\n\nIf you answered yes to all three, you likely qualify.\n\nREAL EXAMPLE:\n[CLIENT_TYPE] with [SQUARE_FOOTAGE] sq ft office in [HOME_SIZE] sq ft home:\n• Monthly rent: $[RENT]\n• Office percentage: [PERCENT]%\n• Annual deduction: $[DEDUCTION]\n• Tax savings: $[SAVINGS]\n\nDon't wait until tax season to figure this out.
