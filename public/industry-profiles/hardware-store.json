Here's what to do NOW to avoid a $500+ emergency:\n\n1️⃣ OUTDOOR FAUCETS\n→ Disconnect all hoses (water trapped inside will freeze and crack the pipe)\n→ Install foam faucet covers ($3.99 each at our store)\n→ Shut off interior valve if you have one\n💰 Cost to prevent: $8 | Cost to repair burst pipe: $300-800\n\n2️⃣ EXPOSED PIPES (crawl spaces, garages, exterior walls)\n→ Wrap with foam pipe insulation (we'll show you how)\n→ Seal any gaps where cold air reaches pipes\n→ Know where your main water shutoff is (do you? seriously, go check right now)\n💰 Cost to prevent: $25 | Cost of water damage: $2,000-10,000\n\n3️⃣ WATER HEATER\n→ Drain sediment (YouTube it or ask us—takes 20 min)\n→ Check temperature setting (120°F is ideal)\n→ Look for rust or leaks NOW, not during a cold shower\n💰 Cost to prevent: $0 | Cost of emergency replacement: $800-1,500\n\nWe've got everything you need in stock RIGHT NOW.

I'm saying KNOW what you're getting into.\n\nTHE SMART APPROACH:\n\n✅ Get a real contractor estimate FIRST (even if you're doing it yourself)\n✅ Add 30% to that number for surprises (there are ALWAYS surprises)\n✅ Know which jobs require permits (we can tell you)\n✅ Invest in quality tools for structural work, save on cosmetic stuff\n✅ Have a relationship with a hardware store that knows your project (that's us)\n\nWe've seen people save $50,000 doing smart DIY.\nWe've also seen people lose $30,000 doing dumb DIY.\n\nThe difference?
