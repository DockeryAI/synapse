## Current Session

V6 COMPREHENSIVE GAPS AUDIT & CODE QUALITY ANALYSIS:

**Major Discovery:**
- Phase 10 VoC Enhancement was ALREADY COMPLETE - SEMrush/BuzzSumo integration exists
- All V6 build plan phases 1-12 are complete, not missing any implementation
- Gap analysis revealed code quality issues, not missing features

**Code Quality Analysis:**
- 57/70 test files failing due to V5→V6 type drift (emotional_resonance, qualityScore properties)
- 47 TypeScript errors from components expecting V5 interfaces
- Direct database calls found in 4+ frontend components (governance violation)
- 45+ TODO comments and 30+ "any" types indicating technical debt

**Gap Classification:**
- 2 CRITICAL: Test suite failures, direct DB calls (security)
- 4 HIGH: V5→V6 type mismatches, stub functions, missing imports
- 8 MEDIUM: Technical debt (TODOs, type safety)
- 15 LOW: Code organization issues

**V6 Status:**
- Build plan: 100% complete (all phases 1-12)
- Code quality: 78/100 (needs cleanup but functional)
- Architecture: V1 engine fully implemented with embeddings + connections

## Last Session Summary

V6 ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS & ENHANCEMENT PLANNING SESSION:
- API infrastructure analysis (Reddit/Twitter/Meta-ads/BuzzSumo failures)
- V1 vs V5 alignment verification
- Comprehensive planning for competitive and VoC enhancements
- Data quality insights and API optimization

## Active Feature

V6 Code Quality & Gap Resolution

## Where We Stopped

Completed comprehensive gaps audit. Found V6 build plan 100% complete but code quality issues need fixing (test failures, type drift, direct DB calls).

## Next Steps

1. Fix test suite failures (V5→V6 type references)
2. Remove direct database calls in frontend components
3. Update TypeScript interfaces for V6
4. Clean up technical debt (TODOs, type safety)

## Blockers

None - clear prioritized gap list ready for systematic fixing
