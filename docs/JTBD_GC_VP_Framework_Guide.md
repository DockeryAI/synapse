## Part I: Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

### Origins and Key Figures

Jobs-to-be-Done was conceptualized by **Tony Ulwick** in 1990 when he applied Six Sigma thinking to the innovation process. His first major success came in 1992 when he helped Cordis Corporation reinvent its line of angioplasty balloon products.

While Ulwick invented JTBD, it was **Clayton Christensen** who popularized it after Ulwick introduced the theory to him at Harvard Business School. Christensen featured JTBD in his 2003 book *The Innovator's Solution* and became its most prominent advocate.

**Bob Moesta**, Christensen's collaborator, developed the practical application through his "Demand-Side Sales" methodology, focusing on understanding why customers switch products.

### Core Concept: What is a "Job"?

> "A 'job' is the progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance."
> — Clayton Christensen

The fundamental insight: **People don't buy products—they "hire" them to make progress in their lives.**

The famous milkshake example illustrates this perfectly: Research revealed that half of all milkshakes at a fast-food restaurant were sold before 8 a.m. Standard market research asked about flavor preferences, but JTBD research revealed the actual job: "Help me have an easy-to-hold snack that makes my boring commute more interesting and keeps me full until lunch."

### The Three Job Dimensions

Every purchase decision involves three interconnected job dimensions:

#### 1. Functional Jobs
The practical task a person is trying to accomplish.

- **Definition**: Clear, measurable, outcome-focused goals
- **Example**: "I need to get from point A to point B"
- **Characteristics**: Observable, rational, solution-agnostic

#### 2. Emotional Jobs
How the person wants to FEEL or who they want to BECOME.

- **Definition**: The deeply personal, internal motivations influencing decisions
- **Example**: "I want to feel confident showing my work to peers"
- **Characteristics**: Personal, identity-driven, transformational

#### 3. Social Jobs
How the person wants to be PERCEIVED by others.

- **Definition**: External identity and status considerations
- **Example**: "I want my team to see me as the expert"
- **Characteristics**: Relational, status-oriented, tribal

### The Critical Distinction: Emotional vs Business Drivers

**This is where most implementations fail.** Understanding the difference between TRUE emotional drivers and business metrics wrapped in emotion is essential.

#### BAD Examples (Business Metrics with Emotional Words)

These are NOT emotional drivers—they are functional business outcomes with emotional language attached:

| Statement | Why It's Wrong |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Fear of losing revenue" | Revenue is a business metric |
| "Anxiety about conversion rates" | Conversion is a functional metric |
| "Frustration with manual processes" | This describes a functional pain |
| "Desire for efficiency" | Efficiency is a functional outcome |
| "Worry about missing opportunities" | Still focused on business outcomes |

#### GOOD Examples (True Emotional/Identity Jobs)

These represent genuine identity transformation and emotional states:

| Statement | Why It's Right |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Want to feel proud showing their work to peers" | Identity/self-image transformation |
| "Want to become the go-to expert in their company" | Desired future identity |
| "Want to stop feeling like an imposter" | Internal emotional state |
| "Want to feel confident walking into board meetings" | Emotional state + context |
| "Want to be seen as innovative, not stuck in the past" | Social identity aspiration |
| "Want to feel in control, not overwhelmed" | Emotional state of being |
| "Want to stop dreading Monday mornings" | Visceral emotional experience |

#### The Test: Ask "Is This About WHO They Want to BE?"

For each driver, ask:
1. Is this about their IDENTITY or SELF-IMAGE?
2. Is this about how they want to FEEL internally?
3. Is this about a TRANSFORMATION in who they are?
4. Would they describe this to a therapist, not just a boss?

If the answer is "no" to all of these, it's a functional/business driver, not an emotional one.

### The Four Forces of Progress

Bob Moesta's framework for understanding why people switch solutions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   FORCES DIAGRAM                         │
│                                                          │
│     FORCES PUSHING TOWARD CHANGE (Must overcome)         │
│     ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│     │  F1: PUSH (Struggling Moment)               │     │
│     │  "Something's not working anymore"          │     │
│     │                                             │     │
│     │  F2: PULL (Magnetism of New Solution)       │     │
│     │  "I can imagine a better life"              │     │
│     └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                          │                              │

│                     [SWITCHING]                         │
│                          ▲                              │
│                          │                              │
│     ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│     │  F3: ANXIETY (Fear of the New)              │     │
│     │  "What if this doesn't work?"               │     │
│     │                                             │     │
│     │  F4: HABIT (Inertia of the Present)         │     │
│     │  "I'm used to what I have"                  │     │
│     └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│     FORCES BLOCKING CHANGE (Must be reduced)            │
│                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: Adding more features increases F2 (pull) but can also increase F3 (anxiety). **Reducing anxiety is often more effective than adding features.**

> "Money is made on the anxiety side of the equation. Reducing anxieties around the solution gets them to what you're selling faster."
> — Bob Moesta

### Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI)

Tony Ulwick's systematic approach to applying JTBD:

#### The Job Map

Break down any job into 8 universal steps:

1. **Define** - Determine objectives and plan approach
2. **Locate** - Gather needed items and information
3. **Prepare** - Set up the environment for execution
4. **Confirm** - Verify readiness before proceeding
5. **Execute** - Perform the core job
6. **Monitor** - Check that execution is going well
7. **Modify** - Make adjustments as needed
8. **Conclude** - Finish the job and clean up

#### Desired Outcome Statements

Structure: **[Direction] + [Metric] + [Object of Control] + [Context]**

Examples:
- "Minimize the time it takes to identify qualified leads"
- "Minimize the likelihood of missing important follow-ups"
- "Increase the ability to predict deal outcomes accurately"

#### The Opportunity Algorithm

```
Opportunity Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
```

This gives twice the weight to importance over satisfaction, helping identify the highest-impact opportunities.

### JTBD Interview Methodology

#### The Switch Timeline

Reconstruct the customer's journey from first thought to purchase:

```
TIMELINE STRUCTURE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    isn't working"           out there?"           is right?"            the one"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

#### Key Interview Questions

**For First Thought:**
- "When did you first realize you needed something different?"
- "What was happening in your life/work at that moment?"
- "What was the weather like? What season was it?" (environmental cues)

**For the Four Forces:**
- "What wasn't working with your old solution?" (Push - F1)
- "What did you imagine life would be like with the new solution?" (Pull - F2)
- "What concerns did you have before switching?" (Anxiety - F3)
- "What did you have to give up or change?" (Habit - F4)

**For Emotional Jobs:**
- "How did that situation make you feel?"
- "What would success look like to YOU personally?"
- "How would others perceive you differently?"

## Part II: The Golden Circle (WHY Framework)

### The Model Structure

Simon Sinek's Golden Circle presents three concentric layers:

```
          ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
          │                                     │
          │    ┌───────────────────────────┐    │
          │    │                           │    │
          │    │    ┌─────────────────┐    │    │
          │    │    │                 │    │    │
          │    │    │      WHY        │    │    │
          │    │    │    (Purpose)    │    │    │
          │    │    │                 │    │    │
          │    │    └─────────────────┘    │    │
          │    │           HOW              │    │
          │    │    (Process/Values)        │    │
          │    │                           │    │
          │    └───────────────────────────┘    │
          │              WHAT                   │
          │        (Products/Services)          │
          │                                     │
          └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### WHY (Innermost Circle)
- Your purpose, cause, or belief
- The reason your organization exists beyond making money
- Answers: "Why should anyone care?"

#### HOW (Middle Circle)
- Your unique selling principles and proprietary processes
- The actions you take to realize your WHY
- Answers: "How do you do what you do differently?"

#### WHAT (Outer Circle)
- The products or services you offer
- What everyone knows they do
- Answers: "What do you sell?"

### The Neuroscience Foundation

Sinek connects the Golden Circle to brain structure:

```
BRAIN ANATOMY & GOLDEN CIRCLE ALIGNMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

        WHAT ←──────→ NEOCORTEX
                      • Rational thought
                      • Analytical processing
                      • Language capability
                      • Features & specs

        HOW  ←┐
             ├──────→ LIMBIC SYSTEM
        WHY  ←┘       • Emotions
                      • Behavior & decision-making
                      • Trust & loyalty
                      • NO language capability
                      • "Gut feelings"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Critical Insight**: The limbic system (responsible for decisions and emotions) has **no capacity for language**. This is why people often say "it just feels right" but can't articulate why. When you communicate starting with WHY, you speak directly to the decision-making center.

> "People don't buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do it."
> — Simon Sinek

### Inside-Out Communication

#### The Wrong Way (What → How → Why)
"We make great computers. They're beautifully designed and user-friendly. Want to buy one?"

#### The Right Way (Why → How → What)
"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo and thinking differently. We challenge the status quo by making our products beautifully designed and user-friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?"

### Real-World Implementation: Apple's "Think Different"

Apple's legendary 1997-2002 campaign exemplifies Golden Circle mastery:

**The WHY**: Celebrating individuals who challenge the status quo and think differently

**The Campaign**: Featured Einstein, Gandhi, MLK, Picasso—rebels, innovators, non-conformists

**The Result**: Apple didn't sell computer specs. They sold a belief system. Customers who "think different" bought Apple to express their identity.

**Key Learnings**:
1. **No product features were mentioned** in "Think Different" ads
2. **Universal themes** (creativity, rebellion, innovation) created emotional connection
3. **Identity alignment** made customers feel they were buying WHO they were, not WHAT they needed
4. **Cultural movement** > product marketing

## Part III: Value Proposition Frameworks

### The Value Proposition Canvas

Developed by Alexander Osterwalder as a companion to the Business Model Canvas:

```

└───────────────────────────────────┘    └───────────────────────────────────┘

                         FIT = Alignment between both sides

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Product-Market Fit** is achieved when your pain relievers and gain creators address the customer's most important jobs, pains, and gains.

### Geoffrey Moore's Positioning Statement

From *Crossing the Chasm*, the canonical positioning formula:

```
POSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For [TARGET CUSTOMER]

who [STATEMENT OF NEED/OPPORTUNITY],

[PRODUCT NAME] is a [PRODUCT CATEGORY]

that [STATEMENT OF KEY BENEFIT].

Unlike [PRIMARY COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE],

our product [STATEMENT OF PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATION].

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Example - Amazon (1997)**:
> "For World Wide Web users who enjoy books, Amazon is a retail bookseller that provides instant access to over 1.1 million books. Unlike traditional book retailers, Amazon provides a combination of extraordinary convenience, low prices, and comprehensive selection."

### StoryBrand Framework

Donald Miller's 7-part narrative framework:

```
STORYBRAND SB7 FRAMEWORK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    1. HERO (Customer)         "A character..."
           │
           ▼
    2. PROBLEM                 "...has a problem..."
       • External problem         (the surface issue)
       • Internal problem         (how it makes them feel)
       • Philosophical problem    (why it's wrong)
           │
           ▼
    3. GUIDE (Your Brand)      "...and meets a guide..."
       • Shows empathy
       • Demonstrates authority
           │
           ▼
    4. PLAN                    "...who gives them a plan..."
       • Simple steps
       • Removes confusion
           │
           ▼
    5. CALL TO ACTION          "...and calls them to action..."
       • Direct CTA
       • Transitional CTA
           │
           ▼
    6. FAILURE (Stakes)        "...that helps them avoid failure..."
       • What they'll lose
       • Negative consequences
           │
           ▼
    7. SUCCESS (Transformation) "...and ends in success."
       • What they'll gain
       • Who they'll become

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Key Principle**: Your brand is NOT the hero. The customer is the hero. Your brand is the GUIDE (like Yoda to Luke, Gandalf to Frodo).

### The FAB Framework

Features → Advantages → Benefits (with "So What?" test)

```

**The Rule**: Keep asking "So what?" until you reach an emotional or identity benefit. If you stop at functional benefits, you haven't gone deep enough.

## Part IV: The Neuroscience of Buying Decisions

### The 95% Subconscious Decision

Research reveals that **95% of purchasing decisions are subconscious**, driven by emotional responses rather than rational analysis.

Key findings:
- Emotional brain centers activate **before** rational analysis
- Emotions influence up to **80% of consumer choices**
- The limbic system (no language) makes decisions; the neocortex (language) rationalizes them afterward

> "We think we make decisions based on facts and logic, but we actually make decisions emotionally and then rationalize them rationally."

### Identity and Self-Concept

**Self-concept theory** explains brand loyalty and premium pricing:

- Consumers choose products that reflect or enhance their self-image
- Fitness brands sell **aspirational identity transformation**, not equipment
- Apple sells **belonging to a creative tribe**, not computers
- Peloton sells **the person you'll become**, not exercise bikes

### The Aspiration Gap

The gap between **current self** and **ideal self** drives purchase motivation:

```
ASPIRATION GAP MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     CURRENT SELF                              IDEAL SELF
    (Who I am now)                          (Who I want to be)
          │                                        │
          │                                        │
          └────────────►  THE GAP  ◄──────────────┘
                              │
                              │
                              ▼
                        ┌───────────┐
                        │  PRODUCT  │
                        │  PROMISE  │
                        │           │
                        │ "We help  │
                        │  you      │
                        │  become..." │
                        └───────────┘

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Products that succeed **don't just solve problems—they promise identity transformation**.

## Part V: Framework Integration & Application

### Unified Model for UVP Generation

Combining all frameworks into a cohesive approach:

```
INTEGRATED UVP GENERATION MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: UNDERSTAND THE JOB (JTBD)
├── Functional Job: What task are they trying to accomplish?
├── Emotional Job: Who do they want to BECOME?
└── Social Job: How do they want to be PERCEIVED?

Step 2: MAP THE FORCES (Four Forces)
├── Push: What's not working now?
├── Pull: What better future do they imagine?
├── Anxiety: What fears must be addressed?
└── Habit: What inertia must be overcome?

Step 3: START WITH WHY (Golden Circle)
├── WHY: What belief do you share with them?
├── HOW: What unique approach do you take?
└── WHAT: What specific product/service delivers this?

Step 4: MAP VALUE (Value Proposition Canvas)
├── Jobs ←→ Products/Services
├── Pains ←→ Pain Relievers
└── Gains ←→ Gain Creators

Step 5: TELL THE STORY (StoryBrand)
├── Hero: [Customer] has a problem
├── Guide: [Brand] shows empathy + authority
├── Plan: Simple path forward
├── Stakes: What they avoid / What they gain
└── Transformation: Who they become

Step 6: CASCADE BENEFITS (FAB)
├── Feature → Advantage → Benefit
├── Keep asking "So what?"
└── Reach emotional/identity transformation

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Application to UVP Steps

#### Step 1: Products/Services
- Extract WHAT the business offers
- Map to functional jobs customers need done
- Identify unique differentiators

#### Step 2: Customer Profile
- Identify WHO the customer is
- Extract TRUE emotional drivers (identity transformation)
- Extract functional drivers (practical progress)
- Validate with evidence quotes

**CRITICAL VALIDATION FOR EMOTIONAL DRIVERS:**
```
IS IT A TRUE EMOTIONAL DRIVER?
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ASK:
□ Is this about WHO they want to BE? (identity)
□ Is this about how they want to FEEL? (emotional state)
□ Would they tell this to a therapist, not just a boss?
□ Is this about their self-image or self-worth?

IF NO TO ALL → It's a functional/business driver, not emotional

TRANSFORM IT:
"Fear of losing revenue"
    → "Want to feel confident they won't be blindsided"

"Desire for efficiency"
    → "Want to feel in control of their time"

"Frustration with manual processes"
    → "Want to feel like they're working smart, not hard"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

#### Step 3: Solution Positioning
- Connect customer jobs to your capabilities
- Address the Four Forces (especially anxiety reduction)
- Frame as transformation enabler

#### Step 4: Benefits
- Go beyond features with FAB cascade
- Always reach emotional/identity endpoint
- Structure: "We [feature] so you can [advantage] which means [benefit] so you feel/become [identity transformation]"

**BENEFIT DEPTH TEST:**
```
WEAK BENEFIT:
"We help businesses with Jamie: AI Policy Expert that handles
complex policy queries"

↓ So what?

BETTER:
"Jamie handles policy queries instantly, so your team never
keeps customers waiting"

↓ So what?

STRONGEST:
"Your customers get instant expert answers, so you become known
as the company that actually cares about their time—not just
another faceless corporation"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

#### Step 5: Synthesis (Final UVP)
- Lead with WHY (shared belief/purpose)
- Position customer as hero on transformation journey
- Your brand as guide enabling their success
- Stakes clear (avoid failure → achieve success)
- End with who they BECOME, not what they GET

## Appendix A: Quick Reference Checklists

### Emotional Driver Validation Checklist

- [ ] Is it about identity/who they want to BE?
- [ ] Is it about internal emotional state?
- [ ] Would they share this in a personal context, not just professional?
- [ ] Does it describe a transformation in self-perception?
- [ ] Is it free from business metrics (revenue, conversion, efficiency)?

### Four Forces Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Push: What specific "struggling moment" triggers the search?
- [ ] Pull: What better future can they vividly imagine?
- [ ] Anxiety: What fears must be addressed before they'll switch?
- [ ] Habit: What comfortable behaviors must they change?

### Value Proposition Completeness Checklist

- [ ] WHY: Clear purpose/belief statement
- [ ] WHO: Specific target customer identified
- [ ] PROBLEM: Three levels (external, internal, philosophical)
- [ ] SOLUTION: How you uniquely solve it
- [ ] BENEFIT: Cascaded to emotional/identity level
- [ ] TRANSFORMATION: Who they become
