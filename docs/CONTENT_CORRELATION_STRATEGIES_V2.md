# Content Correlation Strategies V2
## COMPREHENSIVE INSIGHT GENERATION FRAMEWORK

**Date**: November 26, 2025
**Version**: 2.0 - MASSIVELY EXPANDED
**Objective**: Generate 400+ UNIQUE, VARIED insights across multiple angles that drive leads and revenue

---

## THE CORE PROBLEM WITH V1

The current system produces **duplicate insights** because:
1. All insights center on the SAME UVP pain points
2. No differentiation by CONTENT PURPOSE (awareness vs decision)
3. No differentiation by CUSTOMER JOURNEY STAGE
4. No differentiation by CONTENT FORMAT
5. Generic titles using type names, not actual content
6. Same data processed into 200 identical cards

**THE FIX: Multi-Dimensional Insight Categorization**

---

## PART 1: THE 12 INSIGHT DIMENSIONS

Every insight must be tagged across these 12 dimensions to ensure variety:

### Dimension 1: BUYER JOURNEY STAGE

| **Awareness** | Educate about the problem | "Learn more" |
| **Consideration** | Compare solutions | "See how" |

| **Advocacy** | Turn into promoters | "Share your story" |

### Dimension 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGER (Plutchik's 8 + Extensions)
| Primary Emotion | Opposite | Combined Dyads |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|
| **Joy** | Sadness | Joy + Trust = Love |
| **Trust** | Disgust | Trust + Fear = Submission |
| **Fear** | Anger | Fear + Surprise = Awe |
| **Surprise** | Anticipation | Surprise + Sadness = Disapproval |
| **Sadness** | Joy | Sadness + Disgust = Remorse |
| **Disgust** | Trust | Disgust + Anger = Contempt |
| **Anger** | Fear | Anger + Anticipation = Aggressiveness |
| **Anticipation** | Surprise | Anticipation + Joy = Optimism |

## PART 3: JOBS TO BE DONE (JTBD) FRAMEWORK

### Primary Job Categories

For each data point, identify which job the customer is trying to accomplish:

| Job Category | Job Statement | Content Opportunity |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Functional** | "Help me DO something" | How-to, tutorial, guide |
| **Emotional** | "Help me FEEL something" | Story, testimonial, vision |
| **Social** | "Help me BE SEEN as something" | Thought leadership, case study |

### JTBD Content Formula
> "When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

**Example JTBD Insights**:
1. "When I'm losing online quotes, I want to understand why, so I can fix conversion"
2. "When I'm evaluating AI vendors, I want to compare compliance features, so I can choose safely"
3. "When I'm presenting to the board, I want ROI proof, so I can get budget approval"

---

## PART 4: INSIGHT GENERATION RULES

### Rule 1: No Two Insights Can Share ALL Dimensions
Each insight must differ in at least 2 dimensions from every other insight.

### Rule 2: Every Content Pillar Gets Representation
Distribute insights evenly across all 4-6 content pillars.

### Rule 3: Every Persona Gets Addressed
At least 10% of insights must target each persona type.

### Rule 4: Every Objection Gets Content
At least 5 insights must address each major objection.

### Rule 5: Funnel Balance is Mandatory
Never let any funnel stage exceed 40% or fall below 15%.

### Rule 6: Title Must Be Unique and Specific
- BAD: "search_intent + customer trigger: A New Angle"
- GOOD: "Why 70% of Online Insurance Quotes Fail Before Checkout"

### Rule 7: Every Insight Must Have a Clear CTA
No insight without an actionable next step for the reader.

---

## PART 5: CONTENT ATOMIZATION ENGINE

### From 1 Core Insight, Generate 6-10 Variations:

| Variation | Format | Channel |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Blog Post** | Long-form (1500+ words) | Website SEO |
| **LinkedIn Post** | Short-form (150-300 words) | LinkedIn |
| **Twitter Thread** | 5-10 tweets | Twitter/X |
| **Email Subject** | <50 characters | Email marketing |
| **Ad Headline** | <30 characters | Paid ads |
| **Video Script** | 60-90 seconds | YouTube/TikTok |
| **Infographic** | Visual data | Pinterest/LinkedIn |
| **Podcast Outline** | 5-10 talking points | Audio |
| **Carousel** | 5-10 slides | Instagram/LinkedIn |
| **FAQ Entry** | Q&A format | Website/Chatbot |

### Atomization Formula:
**100 unique insights × 6 variations = 600 content pieces**

## PART 10: IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE

### Insight Generation Pipeline

```
Step 1: Data Collection (500+ raw data points)
    ↓
Step 2: Deduplication (0.92 similarity threshold)
    ↓
Step 3: Dimension Tagging (12 dimensions per insight)
    ↓
Step 4: Variety Enforcement (distribution rules)
    ↓
Step 5: Title Generation (unique, specific, actionable)
    ↓
Step 6: CTA Assignment (matched to funnel stage)
    ↓
Step 7: Content Atomization (6-10 variations)
    ↓
Step 8: Quality Scoring (EQ + UVP match + variety)
```

### Deduplication Rules

1. **Content Hash**: First 100 chars normalized → no duplicates
2. **Title Hash**: First 40 chars normalized → no duplicates
3. **Dimension Hash**: Same 8+ dimensions → merge into one
4. **Source Diversity**: Same title from different sources → keep both (validates)
