## 1. The Psychology of Weather and Consumer Behavior

### 1.1 Emotional Impact

Weather directly affects consumer psychology through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Mood Influence**: Research by Persinger and Levesque (1983) found that 40% of all moods are caused by weather combinations, with air pressure and sunshine having the greatest impact.

2. **Spending Correlation**: A Canadian study revealed consumers were willing to pay:
   - 37% more for green tea after sunlight exposure
   - 56% more for gym memberships in sunny conditions
   - Increased spending on alcohol, tobacco, and coffee during cloudy weather

3. **Projection Bias**: Consumers fail to predict how current weather-influenced preferences will differ from future ones, affecting major purchases like cars, houses, and insurance.

### 1.2 Channel Behavior Shifts

Weather conditions influence how consumers shop:
- **Warm/Sunny Days**: Increased brick-and-mortar foot traffic
- **Cold/Rainy Days**: 12% increase in website traffic for retail, home/furniture, wholesale, and clothing verticals

### 1.3 Emotional Targeting Segments

Modern weather-based advertising can target emotional states:

| Segment | Conditions | Consumer Mindset | Best For |
|---------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **Hopeful** | Clear skies, warming | Optimistic, open to new | Product launches, aspirational content |
| **Somber** | Rainy, overcast | Introspective, comfort-seeking | Food delivery, retail therapy, cozy products |
| **Energized** | Bright, moderate temp | Active, social | Outdoor activities, social events |

## 5. Regional Considerations

### 5.1 Relative vs. Absolute Weather

**Critical Insight:** What's "hot" or "cold" is subjective based on location.

- 68°F winter day in Los Angeles = normal
- 68°F winter day in New York = people go outside, BBQ sales spike
- 20°C (68°F) in Scotland = BBQ sales triple
- 24°C (75°F) in London required for same effect

**Implementation:** Segment weather triggers by geographic region, not absolute values.

### 5.2 Seasonal Baselines

Compare current weather to:
1. Monthly average for that location
2. Last year same period
3. Expected norms (what locals consider "normal")

**Example:** A 5°F deviation from normal has more impact than absolute temperature.

---

## 6. Best Practices Summary

### DO:

1. **Use data, not assumptions** - Map historical sales against weather patterns
2. **Segment by location** - Regional weather perception varies dramatically
3. **Have creative ready in advance** - Prepare multiple weather scenarios
4. **Use forecasts proactively** - 16-day forecasts enable planning
5. **Match channel to weather context** - Indoor weather = desktop; outdoor = mobile
6. **Consider emotional targeting** - Weather affects mood, mood affects buying
7. **Track and optimize** - Measure performance by weather condition

### DON'T:

1. ~~Make assumptions about universal triggers~~
2. ~~Wait for weather to happen to create content~~
3. ~~Use same triggers across all regions~~
4. ~~Ignore the emotional component~~
5. ~~Treat weather as binary (good/bad)~~
