# Week 7: Core Authenticity Principle

## The Non-Negotiable Rule

**NEVER MAKE UP STORIES, FACTS, OR STATISTICS**

All content generated by Synapse AI must have verified sources. This is a core platform principle enforced at the architecture level.

---

## Enforcement Mechanism

### SourceVerificationService.ts
- Validates ALL AI-generated content has source attribution
- Blocks content generation without verified sources
- Applies platform-wide, not just to onboarding
- Cannot be bypassed

### Data Structure Requirement
Every piece of extracted data includes:
```
{
  text: "Small business owners",
  confidence: 0.85,
  sourceUrl: "https://example.com/about",
  sourceContext: "Found in 'Who We Serve' section"
}
```

## Customer Success Stories - Special Handling

**Problem:** Customer stories require personal details that cannot be extracted from websites alone.

**Solution:** CustomerStoryInputModal with two options:

### Option 1: Manual Entry (Required Fields)
- Customer name
- Problem they faced
- Solution you provided
- Results achieved (specific numbers/outcomes)
- Optional: Testimonial quote, date

### Option 2: Source Link
- User provides URL to existing testimonial/review/case study
- System extracts details from the link
- Validates link points to real content

**No third option exists.** Customer Success Story posts cannot be generated without one of these two inputs.

## Source Attribution UI

### SmartConfirmation.tsx
- Every extracted item shows "View Source" link
- Clicking opens source URL in new tab
- Builds trust through transparency

### ContentPreview.tsx
- "Sources:" section lists all URLs used
- Authenticity badge: "All facts verified"
- Source attribution displayed for ALL generated content

---

## Platform-Wide Application

This principle applies to:
- ✅ Week 7 onboarding flow
- ✅ Campaign generation (CampaignTypeEngine)
- ✅ Single post creation
- ✅ All existing content generation features
- ✅ Future features

**Integration Task:** Update ALL content generation services to use SourceVerificationService

---

## Testing Requirements

Must verify:
- [ ] SourceVerificationService blocks content without sources
- [ ] Customer Success Story modal blocks submission without complete data OR source link
- [ ] All "View Source" links work correctly
- [ ] Source attribution displayed in ALL generated content
- [ ] Existing platform features now enforce source verification
- [ ] No way to bypass authenticity checks

---

## Why This Matters

1. **Trust:** Users trust content backed by real sources
2. **Legal:** Avoids liability from fabricated testimonials or false claims
3. **Quality:** Forces AI to work with real data, not hallucinations
4. **Brand:** Positions Synapse as authentic, trustworthy platform
5. **Differentiation:** Competitors allow fabricated content, we don't

---

## Implementation Summary

- **Worktree 1:** SourceVerificationService + source tracking in extraction
- **Worktree 2:** CustomerStoryInputModal + source attribution UI
- **Integration:** Apply verification platform-wide, update database schema

**Total added:** ~600 lines of code specifically for source verification and authenticity enforcement
