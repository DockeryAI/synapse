## Core Strategic Priorities

### 1. Video-First Content Strategy

**What It Is:**
TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts are the dominant content formats. Short-form vertical video (15-60 seconds) captures attention and drives engagement.

**Why It Matters:**
- Video content gets 10x+ engagement vs static posts
- Platforms prioritize video in algorithms
- Mobile users prefer video consumption
- Lower barrier to entry (authenticity > production value)

**Content Types:**
- Behind-the-scenes looks (builds trust, shows personality)
- Product demos (shows value in action)
- Customer testimonials (social proof in video form)
- Bite-sized educational content (tips, tutorials)
- Trending audio/challenge participation (algorithm boost)

**SMB Reality:**
With even modest budgets, small businesses can generate massive reach through authentic, mobile-friendly video content shot on phones.

**Production Standards 2025:**
- Mobile-shot is PREFERRED (authenticity over polish)
- Vertical format (9:16 ratio)
- Auto-captions required (accessibility + algorithm boost)
- Hook in first 3 seconds (thumb-stopping power)
- Trending audio when possible (algorithm visibility)

**Synapse Implementation:**
- Video content prioritized in all campaigns
- Auto-caption generation (Whisper API)
- Trending audio suggestions
- Mobile-first preview and editing
- Templates for Reels/TikTok/Shorts

### 2. Platform Selection (2-3 Maximum)

**SMB Resource Reality:**
Most SMBs can realistically maintain 2-3 platforms maximum. More than that leads to burnout and inconsistent posting.

**Platform Selection by Business Type:**

**Local Business (Restaurant, Salon, Retail Store):**
- Facebook (84% of SMBs use it - broad reach, local targeting)
- Google My Business (free, 5x local visibility, "near me" searches)
- Skip: LinkedIn, TikTok (unless targeting Gen Z)

**Retail/E-commerce (Physical Products):**
- Instagram (visual showcase, Shopping features, shoppable posts)
- TikTok (if audience under 40 - viral reach, trending content)
- Add Facebook Shop for checkout integration

**B2B/Professional Services:**
- LinkedIn (thought leadership, professional networking)
- Facebook (community building, testimonials)
- Skip: TikTok, Instagram (lower B2B ROI)

**Service Business (Plumbing, HVAC, Consulting):**
- Facebook (community trust, local testimonials)
- Google My Business (local SEO, review management)
- Skip: TikTok, Instagram (unless highly visual)

**Current Platform Usage Stats (2024):**
- **84% of SMBs use Facebook** (highest reach, broad demographics)
- **60% use social media as primary marketing channel** (outranks email and SEO)
- **81% planned to increase paid social investment** in Q4 2024

**Synapse Implementation:**
- Auto-select 2-3 platforms based on business type
- Prevent platform overload (burnout and inconsistency)
- Focus quality over quantity

## Engagement Best Practices

### Setting SMART Goals

**Framework:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-based

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: "Get more followers"
- ✅ Good: "Gain 500 Instagram followers in 30 days through daily Reels and local hashtags"

**Synapse Implementation:**
Goal-first campaign selection (Authority, Local, Trust, Revenue, Viral) with clear KPIs.

### Mobile Optimization

**Reality:** Majority of social media users browse and shop on phones. Non-mobile-optimized content loses 60%+ of potential audience.

**Requirements:**
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fast loading speeds (under 3 seconds)
- Simplified UX for thumb navigation
- Vertical video format
- Large text (readable on small screens)

**Synapse Implementation:**
- Mobile-first preview mode
- Thumb-scroll stopping tests
- Vertical video templates
- Content formatted for phone screens

### Community Building

**What It Means:**
Social media provides direct communication between businesses and customers. Strong community = loyal customers + brand advocates.

**Best Practices:**
- Respond to every comment (builds connection)
- Address concerns publicly (shows you care)
- Show appreciation for loyal customers (recognition)
- Foster sense of belonging (community over transactions)
- Be authentic and human (show personality)

**ROI:**
Community members have 3x higher lifetime value than transactional customers.

**Synapse Implementation:**
- Community Champion campaign type (14-day local focus)
- Comment response templates
- User-generated content campaigns
- Behind-the-scenes personality content

---

## Influencer Marketing for SMBs

**Myth:** Influencer marketing is only for big brands with celebrity budgets.

**Reality:** Micro-influencers (5K-50K followers) are incredibly effective and affordable for SMBs.

**Micro-Influencer Advantages:**
- More engaged audiences (higher engagement rates than mega-influencers)
- Affordable rates ($50-500 per post, or product trades)
- Local influencers = local customer reach
- Niche audiences = targeted marketing
- Authentic recommendations (followers trust them)

**SMB Strategy:**
- Partner with 3-5 local micro-influencers
- Provide free products/services in exchange for content
- Long-term relationships > one-off posts
- Track performance with unique discount codes

**Synapse Future Feature:**
Micro-influencer finder and collaboration templates.

---

## Content Strategy: Authenticity Over Perfection

**2025 Trend:** People want real, not perfect. Brands that are transparent, creative, and authentic stand out.

**What This Means:**
- Behind-the-scenes content > polished ads
- Founder/team personality > corporate messaging
- Mistakes and learnings > curated perfection
- Real customers > stock photos
- Honest stories > marketing speak

**Examples:**
- ✅ "We messed up this order, here's how we fixed it" (authentic)
- ❌ "We're the best, perfect, amazing" (generic)

**Platform Evidence:**
TikTok's success is built on authentic, unpolished content. Instagram is de-prioritizing overly polished feed posts in favor of Stories and Reels.

**Synapse Implementation:**
- Behind-the-scenes video templates
- "Real moment" content types
- Founder/team personality campaigns
- User-generated content emphasis

---

## Campaign Duration Best Practices

**Research Finding:** SMBs abandon content plans after 2 weeks on average.

**Why Long Campaigns Fail:**
1. Resource exhaustion (small teams burn out)
2. Delayed ROI (need to see results fast)
3. Market changes (trends move quickly)
4. Attention span (both creator and audience)

**Optimal Duration:**
- **3-5 days:** Flash campaigns (sales, events, urgent)
- **7 days:** Standard campaigns (most popular)
- **14 days:** Extended campaigns (bigger goals)

**Avoid:**
30+ day campaigns for SMBs (unsustainable, rarely completed)

**Synapse Implementation:**
- Default: 7-day campaigns
- Flash option: 3-5 days
- Extended: 14 days max
- Always-on baseline: 3-5 posts/week between campaigns

---

## Performance Tracking and Agility

**Best Practice:** Track performance early, pivot if needed.

**Day 3 Checkpoint:**
By Day 3 of a campaign, you should see early indicators:
- Engagement trends (up or flat?)
- Reach patterns (growing or stagnant?)
- Audience response (positive or crickets?)

**Pivot Indicators:**
- Engagement below 2% by Day 3 → adjust content
- Reach not growing → try different format/timing
- Negative comments → reassess messaging

**Agility Advantage:**
New platforms, features, and trends emerge regularly. SMBs that adapt quickly win. Those who rigidly stick to "the plan" fall behind.

**Synapse Implementation:**
- Day 3 performance checkpoints
- Automatic pivot suggestions
- Real-time performance tracking
- Kill switch for failing campaigns

### LinkedIn (B2B Only)

## Key Metrics That Matter for SMBs

**Vanity Metrics (Don't Obsess):**
- Follower count
- Likes
- Impressions

**Business Metrics (What Actually Matters):**
- **Engagement Rate:** Comments + shares + saves (shows content resonates)
- **Click-Through Rate:** How many click your links (shows interest)
- **Conversion Rate:** How many become customers (shows ROI)
- **Customer Acquisition Cost:** How much to get a customer via social
- **Revenue Attribution:** Sales directly from social campaigns

**SMB Reality:**
1,000 engaged followers worth more than 10,000 ghost followers.

**Synapse Tracking:**
Focus on business metrics, not vanity metrics. Track campaign ROI, not just reach.
