## Usage Rules

**This file is SESSION-SCOPED:**
- Write what you're doing RIGHT NOW
- Clear when you finish or run `/cs`
- Never let it accumulate across days

**Long-term work goes in:**
- Build plans (`.buildrunner/builds/BUILD_*.md`)
- Decisions log (`decisions.log`)
- Progress file (`claude-progress.txt`)

**NOT here.** This is scratch space for current session only.
