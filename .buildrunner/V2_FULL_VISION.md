# 🚀 V2 FULL VISION: 100% STRATEGIC CONTENT ORCHESTRATION

## Executive Summary
**Goal:** Transform Synapse from 35% implementation to 100% production-ready Strategic Content Orchestration Engine
**Timeline:** 100 hours over 21 days
**Result:** AI CMO that generates 150+ validated content pieces per business analysis
