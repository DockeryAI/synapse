# Synapse V6 - Vision

## Why We're Building This

Synapse is an AI-powered marketing intelligence platform that generates buyer insights and ad copy triggers. The core goal is to find **unexpected connections** between diverse data sources to create breakthrough marketing angles that competitors would never find.

## The Original V1 Vision

Keep the same engine and exact process that V1 used, but **deconstruct it** so the user can interact with individual components and create their own unique content using the Synapse engine. Tabs exist to see all the data Synapse collected, then used to find unique angles and content ideas.

## What Went Wrong (V5)

Along the way we completely lost the entire narrative of how V1 worked. V5 became emotion-based filtering instead of connection-based intelligence. Now it's something completely different and inferior.

## V6 Goals

1. **Archive all V5 code and rebuild using V1 approach**
2. **The magic is connections between data sources** - tabs must collect THE RIGHT data points, UVP customizes relevance for specific business
3. **Stop focusing on emotion, focus on V1 triggers** - context, timing, cross-domain signals
4. **Fill tabs with V1-style insights** - user selects tabs, Synapse engine uses embeddings to suggest potential connections
5. **All content generated must use V1 method exactly**
6. **Consider how this works across all 6 major industry categories**

## V1's 8 Unique Mechanics

1. **Connection Hint Generator** - Embeddings + cosine similarity + unexpectedness scoring
2. **Cost Equivalence Calculator** - Behavioral economics with emotional value weighting
3. **Content Psychology Engine** - 9 psychological principles (curiosity gap, loss aversion, etc.)
4. **Power Word Optimizer** - Urgency, exclusivity, trust, action word categories
5. **Contrarian Angle Detector** - "Everyone says X, but actually Y" angles
6. **Humor Integration** - Timing-based, self-deprecating, observational styles
7. **Format Generators** - HookPost, DataPost, StoryPost, ContrarianPost, etc.
8. **Cross-Domain Signals** - Weather, calendar, trending topics, reviews, news

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Small business owners and marketing managers
- **Secondary:** Marketing agencies, content creators
